If we had signed agreements, there would have been peace and so many people would not have died. And maybe these rich people of ours, oligarchs damn their souls, are also to blame."

If Russia was so bad, and Ukraine the democratic land of opportunity you would think that would have happened. People risked their lives to flee E. Germany...but there...not so much"
