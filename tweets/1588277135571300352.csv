The burden is on us but it's ok,Ukraine belongs to the European family and we European will always be with America, Ukraine knows this. Russia will pay dearly his escapade."

If Ukrainian national liberation is about de-colonisation why does it claim the Tartars homeland of Crimea? Doesn‚Äôt that contradict those Ukrainian claims? Historically Ukraine is a product of Russo expansionism as much as Russia.

Anyway, your original point of ""advocating peace between Ukraine and Russia"" isn't a very useful one. 
Almost everyone wants peace- it's how you get it that's significant."

My main issue with the Dems is their attraction to so called wokeness abi wokism. But honestly Reps have little to offer. Only MTG can cause a whole lot damage to them. Also their hypocrisy is next to none. Do as I say not as I do.
