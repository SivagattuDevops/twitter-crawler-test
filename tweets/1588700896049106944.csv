Morality is universally applicable. Also probably not the best optics for a pseudo figurehead of Ukraine to be dunking on the cons as they're poised to take the house &amp; senate .
1588700533208252416,Sat Nov 05 01:11:38 +0000 2022,So what could the US really do if a nuclear device went off in Ukraine? A lot of tough talk now. But one device will not lead to the end of the world.

It won't be won. Ukraine will capitulate because you will be out of weapons and support from the west."

For Thanksgiving in Ukraine, seats at the table are empty. Family are missing. They are lucky to have any food.

Republicans do not like to spend American tax dollars for common humanitarian causes.  Republicans generally support the wealthy and corporations.
