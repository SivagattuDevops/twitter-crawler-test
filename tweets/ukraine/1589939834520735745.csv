So imo it's this benefits calculus that is lacking. Although when USA dumps Ukraine things will move very fast."

Most abstentions on that basis. US/UKR voted straight no likely because they are most vehemently anti-Russian. Nothing to do with free speech imo
1589939308827660288,Tue Nov 08 11:14:05 +0000 2022,@DeItaone This is the US plan. They are pushing for a change of the status quo in Taiwan so as to force chinas hand. The US will then claim China is aggressive and do the Ukraine proxy war all over in Taiwan. Amazingly cheap way to recruit cannon fodder and win the propaganda war.
