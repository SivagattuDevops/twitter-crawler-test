1590195635269292035,Wed Nov 09 04:12:38 +0000 2022,@BrynnTannehill I fully support Ukraine to resist Russian invasion. On the other hand I hope more could be done to contain china. I figured the reason Ukraine is not winning immediately is because the west doesn’t want to trigger Russia to use nuclear weapon.
