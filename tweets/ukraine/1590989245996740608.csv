1590988773877510144,Fri Nov 11 08:44:17 +0000 2022,@NOELreports Guys this is lovely to see but it looks to me more like a Ukrainian unit returning to its home barracks and being greeted by families and a wounded Comrade. Whenever Ukraine has success there is stuff like this being mislabeled. Please remain skeptical about Labeling.
