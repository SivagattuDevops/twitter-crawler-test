Pure Land schools believe that rebirth in Amitabha's Western Paradise, Sukhavati, known as the Pure Land, or Pure Realm, is ensured for all those who invoke Amitabha's name with sincere devotion."

I think the things Ukraine needs the most from us right now is air defense, generators, blankets, and warm clothes. We should adopt the call to Winterize Ukraine. Their winters can be like the TX freeze, only 2-3 months of it."

Ukraine is getting so much support from its own people and the West because they're obviously the good guys. If they start shelling their own people for military advantage, that support will dry up quickly."

The US hasn't given Ukraine any of its latest military (I.e. Abrams, fighter jets, long-range precision missiles, attack helicopters or any navy support)"

Our midterm elections have shown that we will support Ukraine. 

Apparently MAGA thinks they can edge out the Military Industrial Complex."
