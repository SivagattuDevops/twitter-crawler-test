1588164141155749889,Thu Nov 03 13:40:12 +0000 2022,This is bad news for the U.S because the dollar is heavily backed by oil. Not to mention that the KSA has stated that they are now supporting China (by forming an oil deal with China) while getting their security and arms from Russia. No longer need the U.S.
