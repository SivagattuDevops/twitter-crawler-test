Winter offensive is coming. If Ukraine holds them off and West can deal with energy crunch, not looking good for Russia. If not, negotiations will start in earnest."

However if #Ukraine liberates #Kherson in the weeks ahead it will be a turning point in this #war. #Russia is at its weakest at the moment. Its the right time for #Ukraine to receive its support from the #West.
