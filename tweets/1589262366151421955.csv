Not picking sides but man is it absolutely miserable watching any of those videos. It's just young men dying for the jeers of people that aren't even involved. Makes me a bit ill.

Russia never wanted Ukraine and Putin is against the expansion of NATOs looking for a chance to destroy Russia. 
As a Indian i can understand the Putin's mindset--"

A known, common (consistent?) problem (theme?) within these authoritarian (evil) &amp; fascist (evil), forms of gov't. Politics runs the war. For Ukraine, moreso military strategy runs the war, while I'm sure along continuum."
