1591111256890822659,Fri Nov 11 16:50:59 +0000 2022,Why should Ukraine negotiate with Putin? He will never negotiate in the sense they understand the word. I still have not heard one convincing reason why US &amp; allies won't give Ukraine what it needs to win and speed up dispatch of a genocidal maniac to dustbin of history. https://t.co/JkzOqMkdZM

If I understand correctly, Ukraine is more important than Haiti, which is less than 2 hours from the United States.  Don't forget Haiti is great on its own despite the difficult situation facing the country"

Russians have advantage and experience of winter wars and Ukraine have high morale plus momentum but offensive at this point is highly unlikely"
