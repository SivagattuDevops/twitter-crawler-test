Now that they're fighting NATO they know that the only way to end this is for Ukraine to surrender, hence the destruction of infrastructure in an effort to destroy the economy. As the offensive begins the bridges on Dnieper will go."
1589251459061002247,Sun Nov 06 13:40:49 +0000 2022,@Kaleno87 @danielmkovalik These are such disgusting lies created by the ruzzian NAZZIS to have a pretext and false justification to invade Ukraine. RuZZia is lying to all his residents since nobody else is believing this bull💩

Ukraine was one of that USSR emblem. And the USSR was never African Champions. Their sole aim was to weaken the West. That’s why White Nationalists love Russia today

This war is waged for them on foreign territory and foreign soldiers, but the EU is losing its resources from sanctions &amp; separation from Russian gas, at a rate even higher than the growing losses from the war for Ukraine

Inflation is out of control, yet we send billions to Ukraine and probably that much to house and pay medical for illegal immigrants. We've been getting several hundred per DAY for almost two years. Biden's inviting another 9/11."

Don't forget leveraging a Billion US Dollars to get a Prosecutor Fired in Ukraine  Afghanistan. 10 percent for the Big Guy  Wide open Border over 4 million illegal immigrants how many are criminals or Terrorists?  Let's go Brandon
1589251433668354049,Sun Nov 06 13:40:43 +0000 2022,"@dotcentauri Could’ve, but many troops were prosecuted in the U.K. and US for not PIDing combatants before making the decision to kill.

Part of my training covered that and it’s a decision that Ukraine have made which makes it look bad on them as a candidate for NATO membership."
