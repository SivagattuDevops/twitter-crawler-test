Putin followed the Minsk agreements, Ukraine violated them

Putin called for talks in Turkey and almost sign an agreement with Ukraine until Boris Johnson and the rest made Zelensky go back 

Putin still calls for talks to this day

You either don't know jack about what's going on in Ukraine (which we both know you do), or that means you're just lying to push an agenda.  Care to admit why?"

Your position is simply to reject the possibility of an agreement.
