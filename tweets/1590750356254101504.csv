On Ukraine, a bipartisan majority supports aid, so the concern was a minority faction could use House control to block it. A small margin makes that less likely."

If the Republicans had won house and senate by enough, the war in Ukraine would be over soon. Zelainski would have already started peace talks with Putin.

1590749923599089665,Thu Nov 10 16:55:11 +0000 2022,Ukraine conflict has shown that missile inventory numbers are a factor. Winning a conflict might involve simply keeping enough of your forces alive while the enemy expends their capabilities (which makes sense considering many targets of ICBMs were reportedly other ICBM sites).
