But it's OK to send millions to Ukraine increasing the national debt on Americans Sounds like a scam to me. Tax payers money to Ukraine and have Americans pay for the taxes they already paid by giving that tax money away

Ukraine was shelling residential areas, and the area of the hydroelectric plant and its dam, threatening large-scale flooding if a rupture occurred. Ukraine have always shelled civilians."

What proof do you have of Zelenskyy’s ring of corruption? We don’t even know about this. Your ex-president is despised in Ukraine as a man who exploited us and made us vulnerable to Russian aggression.

We need to stop him in Ukraine NOW, and inevitably elsewhere in Europe, and also here at home.  A strong united Europe, which Putin has awakened militarily, will also pay dividends if China confronts us in a big way. 1"

The cost is a small % of our single yr budget. I can think of nothing that is a better bargain. UKR is following aggressive NATO acctg rules &amp; US is now auditing. https://t.co/aih73lGxWq

It seems fitting that today is also the day that Ukraine's brave and selfless military men and women have liberated Kherson and restored freedom for their countrymen there.
