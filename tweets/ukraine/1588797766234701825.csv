One small silver lining to Putin's insane criminal invasion of a neighboring democratic country is that virtually nobody in the world now believes this utter crap propaganda...nor ever will again. The tragedy is that the people of Ukraine are paying for this.

That's huge. How do you think the US will respond if a Russian Missile or shell kills some of them? I wish the US had whole Divisions in Ukraine before Fed."
