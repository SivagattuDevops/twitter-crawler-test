1590870686926786560,Fri Nov 11 00:55:03 +0000 2022,@DBChavan The fact is that there is a shortage of wheat in Europe due to the Ukraine Russia war. So there was a huge opportunity to encourage the farmers to grow maximum wheat and export there. But why exactly the opposite decision has been taken? For handful of traders and urban voters.??

Ukraine is one of the most corrupt countries in Europe and lefties just lap up anything government tells them.

No, it was COVID, the Ukraine war, and OPEC.  Other countries recognize this.  Why not Republicans?"
