Negotiations will always exist, no matter the power balance, because surrender is its own negotiation. Rus can mobilize 300k new troops and still tell Ukraine ""hey, if you want to surrender, we're open to that"""

I thought it couldn't get any worse than the U.S.S.R.

But since Putin took over Russia has become a hellhole, and now a meat grinder with the Russian war in Ukraine
