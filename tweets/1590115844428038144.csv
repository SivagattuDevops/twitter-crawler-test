1590115380475092992,Tue Nov 08 22:53:44 +0000 2022,@irgarner @minna_alander So many questions. But I‚Äôm not smart enough to understand how this develops in 2023. My main question is: how can Ukraine find a way to have a border with the orcs? Do they have to create a demilitarized zone or something like that? Will the west support a DMZ on orc land?
1590115379590082561,Tue Nov 08 22:53:44 +0000 2022,"@POTUS How much did you make from Burisma Oil Co. in Ukraine? 

Why did you immediately end the pipeline part of our oil independence?

Why are you depleting and selling our oil reserves?

They have to remove their troops from this country. And the international community is standing with Ukraine. Ukraine has to be in the driver's seat"

May they vote against the MAGA influence.
What always bothered me most about Trump was his embrace of Autocrats.  The domestic agenda was just tax cuts for the rich and buffoonery.   But Ukraine must be fully supported."
