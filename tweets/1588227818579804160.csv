For some reason Trump is being blackmailed by Putin. It was Russia that spied on Hillary Clinton to tamper with the US presidential election."

The ""upper classes"" of Russia as you put it decided to invade Ukraine purely because they wanted. the ""both sides"" argument is literally Russias propaganda to try and spin that they aren't responsible."

Ukraine gets billions to sacrifice its population and enter the weapons black market and Haiti gets its gringo led 4th occupation in 100 years."

If any of our neighbors were in such a situation, we would also help. It is empathy rooted in a tragic history. Nobody helped us."

They have destroyed a small country and they have held the Russians at bay with a little help from us! Since it's already a mess in Ukraine why not dust Russia off in that war torn country and end Russian BS!!
A Good idea!"
