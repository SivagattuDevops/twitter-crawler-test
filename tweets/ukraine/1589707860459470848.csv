The Revolution of Dignity posed no threat to Russia, it was internal to Ukraine. There was no justification for military involvement by the invaders; it was a shameful landgrab driven by putin‚Äôs desire to rebuild the USSR."

We left two years ago (not 6 years ago) and the pandemic kicked in just a couple months after. Ukraine has been at war with Russia which has caused problems also.
