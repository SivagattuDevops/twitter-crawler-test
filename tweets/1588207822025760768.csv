I know for facts that they are interests driven.  In Africa, we also need to be interets driven. What s in it for me in Ukraine when only 17% of the grains reached Africa, yet 36% went to Europe? I am not naive."

This is like an appeal to the magic fairy of diplomacy.
Please tell me if you envision Ukraine giving up any of their sovereign territory. If you do, you are naive. Ukraine is winning &amp; Russia is losing territory it occupies every day."

I dont understand what you're getting at here.  Trump weakened our alliance with them and strained the alliances by going out of his way to piss them off. Trump also withheld defense funds for Ukraine to help Putin.

1588207514918723594,Thu Nov 03 16:32:33 +0000 2022,@sumlenny You need a 101 history lesson. There was no 'Ukrainian manpower' factor. At all. The USSR's soldiers came from every region including Ukraine and all fought and died to overcome Nazi Germany. Pretty much 25 million of them. So shove off with your revisionist twaddle.
