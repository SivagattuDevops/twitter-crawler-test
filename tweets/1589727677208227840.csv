If this proves anything it demonstrates that allowing citizens to own; javelins, tanks, and jets is the correct decision of any government.

It also wouldn't hurt to give the general populace the billions in taxes back."

Also, the US didn't ""go in"", Russia did ""go in"". And Russia itself and especially its outer provinces are already pretty much failed states. Ukraine knows what both worlds feel like and they understandably and freely want to be part of Western culture."
