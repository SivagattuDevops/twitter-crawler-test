The high inflation he caused all the shortages, the money he spent early on contributed to this inflation, the war with Ukraine happened due to Biden letting Putin have Nordstream 2 etc."

It would have been better for whole Ukraine if they were not killing people in Donbass. This all happens when a Joker rules the country.
