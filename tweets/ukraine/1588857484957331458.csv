Blair is a war criminal, any sane person would hate him for that. Starmer wants to recreate New Labour, so he's pushed socialists like me out. He's also never once pushed for deescalation in Ukraine, so why should I trust him not to go to another war?"

Remember Minsk accords countersigned by De and Fr?? Remember 8 years of Ukraine bombing Donbass and 14000 dead?? Remember promise not to expand NATO eastwards?
