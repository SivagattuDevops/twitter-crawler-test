Russia is finished as the bogey man of Europe, we don't have to spend Trillions on defending Europe from Russia in the coming years."

How about you ask Lebron why he didn’t speak up about his boy? Oh yea, bc he’d be a hypocrite and knows that his situation is 100x worse. Nike and it’s tied to China and the daily genocide occuring - Yea the shoes that 90% of the league wears?"

So your going to have U.S soldiers in towers shooting immigrants? How about reshoring every factory in china to the U.S and Mexico. Make both places first rate and the problem is much less.

With more investment into the private sector, I wouldn’t be surprised if they surpass us soon."

Why?

It underpins understanding of values that family comes first &amp; that includes sacrifice &amp; civic duty
