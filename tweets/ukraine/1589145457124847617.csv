Their culture is probably more Chinese than modern China now. 11% of them when polled would be okay with reunification. I don't see why China needs to harp on this. Let them be.

That's a bit like saying California should be left to it's own devices by all parties. Taiwan is China. But its status leaves room for the US to fuck with China. And they will take every opportunity to fuck with China.
