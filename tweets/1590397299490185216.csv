Truth is Russia will call it an olive branch and call for a ceasefire then when Ukraine refuses bombard it with Iranisn Balkistic missiles. Meanwhile India has no moral centre at all.

In order to win the war with the west you have to sometimes give up territory in Ukraine. This causes the west to send more weapons to Ukraine, which can then be destroyed.

Eventually Ukraine‚Äôs army will collapse."

With Democrats holding enough seats to likely continue support at current levels, Russia knew Kherson was lost.
