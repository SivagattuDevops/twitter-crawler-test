They just don't actively oppose it because the Chinese govt throws a tantrum, so it's easier to keep them quiet this way. If you think it's supported, you really are sucking the proopganda down and not noticing you are being lied to."

Entitlements are much larger than military spending. So, that is the main starting point.
