Two big mistakes by US I agree (2nd Iraq war, not 1st; otherwise Kuwait would have been Iraq, don‚Äôt forget that). Necessary move of Biden to get out of Afghanistan. But Ukraine was attacked by crazy dictator."

Ukraine committed to giving up its nukes under the 1992 Lisbon protocol. And NATO told Ukraine it would invade and partition the country if it didn't hand over its nukes. https://t.co/bupfnfsuKC
