Would be prudent to demand that the russia reforms its education to examine colonial past critically, denuclearize, and no military. And of course war crimes trials for the gopniks in charge"
1588693945709641730,Sat Nov 05 00:45:27 +0000 2022,"Interesting observation and a question for Polish speakers.  Historically, in English we used to say ""in the Ukraine"" rather than ""in Ukraine""; similarly in Polish it *was* ""na Ukrainie"".  But my understanding is that since the early 90s it's now ""w Ukrainie"".  Is that right?

America grows weary of this pointless proxy war and Russia will defend its people in LPR and DPR at any cost. Surrender while you still can.
