My hypothesis is: 

-Republicans Win Midterm Election (less Ukraine Aid packages)

-Due to Economic strife in EU
(Ukraine Fatigue sets in thus less support)

-Ukraine gets a new leader (Pro Russian Leader as before)

-“Peace” Negotiations begin."

We pretty much don't buy products off Ukraine and very little off the UK and vice-versa. The economic pain has come mostly from not managing gov't spending. Gov't overspends and we have to over pay. Nothing is free.
