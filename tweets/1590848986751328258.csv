Russia have been planting explosives a few months ago and have been on newspapers for a long time. Russia will not get away with this. UN inspectors and history will catch up.

Bucha, all the murder, rape and torture the Russians have done in Ukraine. I see supporting Russia as morally disgraceful to be honest. Just saying.!"
