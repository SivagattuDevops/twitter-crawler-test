Biden used every excuse possible as to why inflation was rising, his latest being because of “Putin’s war.”  What a load of crap.  Inflation was rising long before Russia invaded Ukraine. https://t.co/Qqno5Z8GyQ"
1591107608131567617,Fri Nov 11 16:36:29 +0000 2022,@les_politiques There's a very good reason for the bizarre Canadian support to Ukraine and it goes black to Ukrainian collaboration with Nazis during the massacres occurred between 1941-43. Many of those who helped the Einsatzgruppen immigrated to Canada with Edmonton as first destination.
