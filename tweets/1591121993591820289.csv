In Indian perspective Russia Ukraine war may be futile but strategic point of view says that this was a matter of sovereignty and integrity of Russia. It was bound to happen because its script has been started to written by USA.

One that could considerably shift global power dynamics for the better and give pause to autocratic regimes bent on imperialistic aspirations. https://t.co/SC7eHqrz6R
