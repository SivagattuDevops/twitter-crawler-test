As we all know;

If ruzzia stops fighting the war ends, but if Ukraine stops fighting , Ukraine ends.

So please, no more of #PooTins snivelling cowards trying to blame the victims.

When nobody knows right from wrong and everybody hesitates, then you can commit your crimes with impunity and blame your enemies.
It's powerful, but it leaves ""the zone"" divided, destroyed and in anger. Eventually, it can backfire."
