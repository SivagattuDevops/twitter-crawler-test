A nuclear war can remain local and be won, when the object of the war is essential to one party‚Äôs strategic interest, but not essential to the opponents strategic interest.

I.e. Eastern Ukraine.

Russia can therefore win by always escalating one step further than NATO can."

Not really - remember pre-war when all the usually most reliable Russia commentators were saying they wouldn't do it since doing so would be so crazy and foolish? That's certainly what I thought!
