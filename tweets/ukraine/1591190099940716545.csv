They almost eliminated Belarusian language. The same happened in Ukraine with lesser success, but the anger is lingering."

He plays a NATO puppet money laundering president in an obscure Russian border country caught up in the war of a lifetime when Russia comes in stop the Nazis from establishing a front at their door.  Adult violence.
