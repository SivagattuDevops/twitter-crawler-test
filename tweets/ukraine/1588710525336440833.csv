1588709991724486657,Sat Nov 05 01:49:13 +0000 2022,I hear that Biden is going to give the Ukraine more money. I think they should look into Solinski‚Äòs bank account and see if all those millions and billions of dollars are going in his account and not to help in the aid to win the war I feel like they‚Äôre taking a vantage of us!
