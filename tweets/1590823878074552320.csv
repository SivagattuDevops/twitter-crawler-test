1590823510917554176,Thu Nov 10 21:47:35 +0000 2022,@Faytuks LOL umm no green corridor was established for any retreat. Don‚Äôt blame the U.S for a fake agreement and Ukraine for not allowing the terrorist invaders to retreat in peace. I‚Äôd ignore it too if so. Let them run with their tails tucked between their legs.
