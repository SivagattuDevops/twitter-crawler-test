Russia decides a bad president that wants to interfere into Ukrainian affairs which stupid excuses like I’m making war to bring peace etc. We’re helping Ukraine because it’s our interest if Ukraine wins this war.

1588737206243717120,Sat Nov 05 03:37:21 +0000 2022,@thehill We have to thank President Biden and the democrats. They did not leave Ukraine alone. Now republican candidates are saying they're not going to help Ukraine. Because they want Putin to invade everywhere. Vote for democratic candidates to make the world and the USA peaceful..
