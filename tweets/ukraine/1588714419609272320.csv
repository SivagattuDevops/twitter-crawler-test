1588713907484786691,Sat Nov 05 02:04:47 +0000 2022,@jwhitleyamery @ChuckPfarrer Take out the Black Sea fleet instead. To squeeze Ukraine out of access to the Sea of Azov snd thd Black Sea protecting Russia's main trade artery is one of the prime purposes of the war. Without a fleet it is all for nothing. Putin will have no choice but to sue for peace.

But the narrative that we should not have sent that money to Ukraine when there is so much need here is... not well-founded"
