1591249954219360257,Sat Nov 12 02:02:07 +0000 2022,"@Lambe8Mike @_roundfifty @RebelNews_AU @RebelNewsOnline Perhaps that why Russia knows it can attack Ukraine now. 
Because they know the USA has been weakened by their beliefs in cooked conspiracies. 
And you know it's russia that spends many millions spreading disinfo online. Perhaps that's why you seem to side with them re this war?"
1591249950314225665,Sat Nov 12 02:02:06 +0000 2022,"@AnnaVu123123 @OskanaShadow that's a quote from Putin. Again Russia today is not one people, its a dozens of ethnic groups but when Putin says Russia and Russian people he's talking about Slavic Russia and their historical ties to Ukraine, not east Asian Russians."

How did america specifically overthrow Ukraine's pro russian government? Why has Ukraine consistently voted pro European since the supposed coup? Do you think Zelensky actually has the support of his people?

1591249899705626624,Sat Nov 12 02:01:54 +0000 2022,@GoneCraig @ggreenwald Neither party would have been positive for Ukraine. However it is a proxy war and is a disgrace either way. If there were no Russians in Ukraine Putin wouldn't be there. The US can't make these claims for its wars. Further Putins claim of genocide was factually correct
