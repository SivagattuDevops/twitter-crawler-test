The longer this conflict takes the more likely the defeat of the west becomes. No matter how much money and arms they send to Ukraine. What then? NATO troops in Ukraine? Nuclear war? Or peace?
1589760176571445248,Mon Nov 07 23:22:17 +0000 2022,4. The Russian economy is fine despite western sanctions. Russia now sells oil and gas to China and India with Turkey becoming the new energy hub to Europe. Meaning Russia can afford this war for as long as it wants. Are western taxpayers prepared to spend a trillion in Ukraine?

3. Russia prepares a major offensive this winter with up to 500,000 fresh troops. How will Ukraine stop them with their depleted army?"

The US proxy war in Ukraine is not goin well. Let‚Äôs ask some important questions and see if you have the answers. Feel free to reply.

1. How long will people in the West accept sending billions to Ukraine while they have a major cost of living crisis?"

In 2014, Putin annexed Crimea. Trump was not in the White House, but Biden was. Biden was also specifically tasked to oversee American interests in Ukraine. 
4 yrs of Trump, Ukraine lost no territory. 
Now Ukraine is losing even more territory. Who's in the WH?"
