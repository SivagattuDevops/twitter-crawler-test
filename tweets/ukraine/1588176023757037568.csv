Support the people of Iran.
Nayak and Mojahedin Khalq are not representatives of Iranian people.

I think we delivered as many as possible.

By the end of Sep. the Pentagon said we had spent over $16 billion, which isn't insignificant."

Putin‚Äôs invasion is to eliminate Ukraine and re-absorb into Russia (his bizarre long article). We should not delude ourselves. This from 2015. https://t.co/9CBzpjQYjI
