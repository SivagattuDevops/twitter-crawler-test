This ""only Turkey did anything"" shit is so grating, especially since Turkey has been at best a shifty ally this war."

Napolean did not have the maneuver elements available to the modern battlefield, and hitler invaded the Soviet Union, not Russia. At the time Ukraine was actually a buffer that likely saved Moscow. Nobody advocates invasion of Russia."

I agree that the rest of Ukraine has rallied support for Zelensky, and view this as (you say) a 9/11"
