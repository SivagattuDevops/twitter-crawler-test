Rome wasn't built in a day and as i said, with your hegemony weakening, as all parameters show, it will only accelerate."

Can you tell anywhere Russia threatens to use nuclear weapons on Ukraine?
U can't because Russia hasn't ever threatened to do so. 
China is only highlighting what Putin has always said."

Since 1990, UK emissions have halved and in 12 days China emits the same CO2 as the UK does in a year.
The cost of net zero will see more UK companies moving abroad, where they will cause more CO2 emissions than before."
