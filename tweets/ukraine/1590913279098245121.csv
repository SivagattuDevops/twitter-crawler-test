Putin has greater credibility amongst global leaders governing 80% of world population. Unfortunately you allow your opinion to be governed by western narratives.. US NATO killed millions during Putins tenure, but Putin bad?"

1590912667241574401,Fri Nov 11 03:41:52 +0000 2022,@General57202026 Putin is going to lose his Nation. If we give it to the Ukraine we will only increase Russia. MBS is not a fight we have to fight. I can't fix Bush's lies. That is a danger right now. If I could explain the truth of the Bush's and it be believed I would. Just can't fight that.
