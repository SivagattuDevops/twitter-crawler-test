If you attack a Westerm democracy, as did, Gaddafi, Al Queda and now Russia, the West will attack back. End of. I support all and any means in those attacks to defend democracy. These are wars, not games. You fight to win. Ukraine will be supported to win."

The US and other allies refuse to send them because of appeasement. Jake Sullivan is possibly making suspicious deals behind Ukraine's back. War could be over if the west  was more resolute. None of this is inevitable. ü§∑

Possibly the start of the end of democracy for a prolonged period of time and thus a destabilised western world. 
This will have repercussions for war in Ukraine, plays into Putin's hand.
Closer to home, all this will be very bad for the UK."
