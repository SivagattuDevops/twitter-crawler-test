Ukraine started the war in Donbas in 2014 and could have finished it by fulfilling Minsk agreements. Ukraine was abusing people of Donbas and anyone who was remotely pro-Russian. Russia cannot be expelled, they got nukes. Reality check is what Ukraine needs"

Obviously they will look west for support. They have been fighting mongol hoards for too long .. and nothing has changed.  No one will forget or forgive the genocide.

Too bad they don't have the balls to stand up to their own govt who treats them way worse than the Ukrainian military.

40% of Ukraine's energy system has been damaged or destroyed by Russian attacks.

In the case of a total blackout, water supply and sewage would also stop working.""
