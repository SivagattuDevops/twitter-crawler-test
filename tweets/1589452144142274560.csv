So why is the price so high and don’t use Ukraine as an excuse prices were up over a dollar before the war. It’s their stupid restriction and verbal war against fossil fuel."

Is she really working for Canadians?"

And have you considered how that security assistance to Ukraine is also ensuring our security and our allies overseas? Btw- Republicans also voted to give money to Ukraine.

Russia would agree to leave Ukraine if the US agreed to leave also. It would do this because the deal would represent a huge geopolitical win for Russia.
