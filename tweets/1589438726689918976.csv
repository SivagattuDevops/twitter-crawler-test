This began long before his time - he has to defend the Ukraine against invasion, or seek an overt alliance with China and declare war on the US (to beat them to the punch).... Neither are great options."

If your enemy is willing to do something you are not, that is a power you willingly give up. You then see an ally doing the same and attack him instead of you enemy. It's pathetic and repulsive."
