I doubt there would be any quick and easy solution and Russia has proven itself an unreliable supplier."
1591065008389382144,Fri Nov 11 13:47:13 +0000 2022,"@OlenaHalushka Because unlike Ukraine, the Western leaders are afraid of Putin. Putin's verbal threats have a great effect on their minds for unknown reasons."

1591065003440099329,Fri Nov 11 13:47:12 +0000 2022,"@Golgomessh @aleksgruman1 @unusual_whales Aside from the $3B they‚Äôve already been given since the war started ? Don‚Äôt think so.  The first package Biden sent to ukraine could‚Äôve ended the homeless crisis in America alone, the second could‚Äôve helped child hunger. Sending more money to ukraine is not helping taxpayers"

1591064981138726915,Fri Nov 11 13:47:06 +0000 2022,@adnashmyash @OzKaterji It's a niche of authoritarian leftists. They think Putin is Stalin. The wider majority of leftists support Ukraine. Bots from Russia on Twitter don't count as the EU.

That and the laws of supply and demand."
