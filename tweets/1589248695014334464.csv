He has also been warned thru back channels of its consequences. Ru does have a first nuclear strike if integrity of its territory is attacked. That‚Äôs why it hastily annexed parts of ukr

In the era in which all the world economies are declining at rapid pace, China is on the verge of collapse, here is a blind hater who cannot see that IMF projected more than 7% growth rate for India, under Modi. So stop whining haters!"

I guess now they're gonna have to start liking China, same as they did with Russia and North Korea. Who know, maybe Iran will be next?"

They appear to be to regular people however everything is heavily controlled starting with media. Im not saying russia and china are much better but they are not as bad as most of the east countries do allow you to hear the other side as well
