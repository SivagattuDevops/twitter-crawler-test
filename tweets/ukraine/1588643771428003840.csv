1588643500324958208,Fri Nov 04 21:25:00 +0000 2022,@newsmax There are so many crimes to choose from.  I'm pretty sure the Democrat media would have screamed to impeach Trump if he withheld US Foreign Aid to Ukraine until a prosecuter was fired.  Or maybe the Big guy getting a 10% cut for work done for the Chinese Communist Party.

Russia's attack on Ukraine is of this kind. An empire usually means something much larger and involves dominating pre-existing power structures."

1588643427138572288,Fri Nov 04 21:24:43 +0000 2022,@MrIslandMan67 Same here. The inflation and cost of living issues are because the money used on the pandemic and furlough and now a war in Ukraine needs paying back. Politics really doesn't have anything to do with it.
