Europeans despise nazism and many fought nazism. Lavrov recently seemingly being a racist himself choose to emphasize the anti-Russian part of Nazism, thereby calling all of Europe Nazi, all Ukrainians of course."

What is nonsense is that this is in no way similar to organized crime groups confronting each other. Ukraine being highly corrupt it not sufficient to warrant the comparison. Mafias are not supported by NATO with alot of international relations being played and mass

Anyway your boss in #Ukraine has said that you need to bomb Iran and their ability to produce drones so make sure you get right on that since you're a lover of peace. As a progressive Democrat you disgust me!"

That's utterly absurd and completely ignores Russia's strategic ambitions with Ukraine as well as the effect it's meddling has had on events. Your argument has the look of either being na√Øve or not in good faith."
