Yeah, just like when Russia was provoked into invading Finland, Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia and Finland.

Oh wait, those were baseless wars of aggression and expansion that took the USSR 50 years to admit to what they had done."

There is no need for Ukraine to compromise. They did not start this war! Russia did, so it must:
* withdraw completely from Ukraine 
* pay reparations for damages
* return the children that they stole from Ukraine
* pay for mine removal
* return POWs"
