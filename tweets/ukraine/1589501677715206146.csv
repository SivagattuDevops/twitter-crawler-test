No way that could've been staged by the enemy for propaganda purposes. You can bend over backwards and Type this shit all you want. Ukraine has a fucking nazi regiment in their army.
1589501043536429056,Mon Nov 07 06:12:34 +0000 2022,@basedIndian21 I just find it interesting that every once in a while news leaks from the WH that is negative towards ukraine. Last week it was Biden got annoyed at Zelensky and before it was WH angry that üá∫üá¶ killed Dugins daughter and this week it's urging üá∫üá¶ to negotiate. Why the leaks?
