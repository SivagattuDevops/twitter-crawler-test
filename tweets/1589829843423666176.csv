It's the nazis way

To accuse others of their own faults

It's getting old at this point

Don't like canada

And democracy

We be got a war in the ukraine you can go fight

Grab that shitty rifle you've got

And a checkered shirt"

1589829116270116865,Tue Nov 08 03:56:13 +0000 2022,@RG_Horvath @RadioNational The hypothesis is absurd. Putin had few threats to his power internally. By invading Ukraine he has potentially created more risk and threats to his power and regime. There are much more credible explanations for this war.

To address inflation, rising gas prices, rising grocery bills, rising electric costs, rising crime rates, drug deaths, invasion at the southern border, laundering $ in Ukraine, mandated jabs/mask, socialist freebies &amp; handouts, etc. VOTE REPUBLICAN!"

He also understood that to beat Russia, we must have energy independence from them, and lastly, we‚Äôd likely have a booming economy. https://t.co/2jlVxWUXCF"

Russia went so far as starting the war in Europe and initiating  take over of the whole of  Eastern Europe.
Ukraine fighting for its own sovereignty stopped that."

Many are worried about the outcome of the US elections."

Russian invasion of ukraine might be a bit stupid but we will only know for sure a few years after it ends. This comparison is dumb"
1589829090751971328,Tue Nov 08 03:56:07 +0000 2022,"If that looks like a gruesome scenario, it's useful to remember that it worked this way once already, in 2014.

Then Russia under various wild justifications, from CIA on Maidan to Russian speakers being prosecuted, invaded Ukraine with tanks and military. (See Girkin's story)."
1589829084393394176,Tue Nov 08 03:56:05 +0000 2022,"3/6 Putin wants us to elect politicians who he himself promotes in the West.
The US elections are strategically the most important ones to Putin as the US is a major Ukraine's supporter.
If enough MAGA republicans get to power Ukraine might be in trouble."

So, Putin unleashed massive propaganda campaign to change western public opinion on support for Ukraine.
He bought some politicians in the West who are openly for decrease of support for Ukraine and wants us to vote for them."

Although, Ukraine is dependant on the Western arms supplies. Without Western weapons Ukraine would not be able to win this war.
Putin knows that.
He also knows how democracies work."
