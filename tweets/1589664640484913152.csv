You don‚Äôt seem to know what you‚Äôre talking about. There have been long standing agreements that Ukraine broke."

How much of Ukraine's energy grid replaced with new tech? Dams rebuilt? Hospitals and universities rebuilt?

2. Revenge against Biden
3. Ukraine

Rightists and Leftists dislike this ""empire"" for their own reasons obviously and want it to lose in this proxy war."

Btw- you may also want to pray that there isn't a red wave tomorrow- a lot of folks on the right are pro-Putin and want to choke funds to Ukraine."

I‚Äôm not a fan of either Russia or Ukraine, but Ukraine chooses violence over negotiation b/c it puts money in the pockets of politicians and hurts its people. I appreciate that you are a proud Ukrainian, but your leaders are compromised"

Both were removed, although the latter took longer (several weeks)."

Snake island was a lie. The Ghost of Kyiv was a lie. Even Bucha was lied about because these sources won't acknowledge the role of the SBU killing civilians. We're tired of it"

And, just as a quick reminder. Ukraine isn't in NATO, Ukraine *wasn't* going to join NATO, and Russia still invaded in 2014 and in February of this year."
