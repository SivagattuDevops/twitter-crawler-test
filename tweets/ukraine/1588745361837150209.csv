Of course, you are dead wrong. Citizens are fleeing Democrat states because those assholes masked us up, closed our schools and businesses, and released drug-crazed murderers back on the street. Ahem...the war in Ukraine."

But there are rules in war to make it decent very often if not always this is disregarded.

For example I supported the war in Iraq but there's more than 1000 cases of rape by US soldiers"
