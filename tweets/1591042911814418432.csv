1591042543885631488,Fri Nov 11 12:17:57 +0000 2022,"For much of 2022, @CNN &amp; @MSNBC were non-stop White Lives Matter coverage of #Russia invasion of #Ukraine. #USA responded by gathering @NATO into a massive proxy war, &amp; aside from the massive loss of life &amp; property &amp; the risk of global thermonuclear omnicide, global commodity"
1591042541344157698,Fri Nov 11 12:17:56 +0000 2022,"@mikepompeo Yes, in the high prices i pay for everything now. We need to stop being the world police and start focusing on us. All this money sent off would be better spent in our local neighborhood's. Fact is, in not in Ukraine, i could care less about what happens there."

1591042530195673088,Fri Nov 11 12:17:53 +0000 2022,@letheisslow putin’s ready for “dialogue” because Ukraine is kicking his ass on the battlefield and his MAGA cohort lost in the US midterm elections.
1591042526324346880,Fri Nov 11 12:17:53 +0000 2022,@gummibear737 It's not about Ukraine being corrupt. Our current gov is corrupt and is laundering money through Ukraine. The military equipment manufacturers who are SO powerful and hated Trump's peace are making huge profits. Is there any doubt about this? THEY do not care about deaths.
1591042522167418880,Fri Nov 11 12:17:52 +0000 2022,"@SpaJw Well, the reason we don't appreciate the sacrifice is Ukraine has been hiding its casualty figures."
1591042512709619713,Fri Nov 11 12:17:49 +0000 2022,"Wow, I 100% believed this was impossible this year. A huge YAY to Ukraine for thinking big!

1591042503230115840,Fri Nov 11 12:17:47 +0000 2022,"@chrismogaku Russia's neighbors watched Russia slaughter Checneya, grab a chunk of Georgia, grab Crimea and fund separatists in Ukraine. I wonder why they were interested in joining NATO.

The US doesn't give a shit about diplomacy chess games as long as they can make money off the country"

1591042496234127360,Fri Nov 11 12:17:45 +0000 2022,"@TorontoStar Amazing how all these rigged polls support exactly what the system needs to maintain or extend control, from forced vaccinations to stripping human rights to support for our war in the Ukraine."
1591042492568592387,Fri Nov 11 12:17:45 +0000 2022,It seems like Ukraine isn't the only illegal occupation that Russia is engaged in. Interesting article about how a small yet strategic group of Artic islands belonging to the US were taken by the Russians by force. https://t.co/0symCA24J6
