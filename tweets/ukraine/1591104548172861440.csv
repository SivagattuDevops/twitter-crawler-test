""Public servants"" are no different than anyone else. Grow up. Second, congratulations on supporting Ukraine with your profile pic. It's a money laudering and child trafficking operation run by NAZIs. Great job. 👍"

Dear American, do you want your debt paid for you? Do you want lower taxes and cost of living? Just ask Ukraine to give you your money back!
