You need to get the f out of Ukraine. It's not yours, never will be, and no amount of fake elections and propaganda will change that. Just admit defeat, it's inevitable unless you want to nuke everyone back into the stone ages."

The Russian invasion of Ukraine is worth opposing, but supporting the Ukrainian opposition is going to have a ripple effect throughout Europe, serving as sort of a Neo-Nazi version of ISIS."

The EU is deliberately creating conflict in Ireland by only recognising one community. The EU is actively funding Putin's military and not arming Ukraine. A huge trade deficit with the EU isn't sustainable.

It‚Äôs absurd to hate on them for a UN vote many years ago.
