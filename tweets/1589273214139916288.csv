Your hard work and prayers paid off!"

It fails to put it in context - their death rate would be in the MILLIONS without zero-COVID - but it's still more informative than most articles about China's COVID policy. https://t.co/i1hrnSiCBw"

It was reasonable to be fearful early on...but why did our government never cut off flights from China or initiate any screening at airports until it was far too late to do any good?
