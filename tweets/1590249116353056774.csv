Some might call me work for passionately supporting Ukraine, for being against the trans bathroom bill etc. it’s important to know the line. 

Toxic “woke” is when you get lectured for “micro aggressions” bc you made a joke"
1590248546816897024,Wed Nov 09 07:42:53 +0000 2022,@RonPaulInstitut You spread the propaganda of this murderous dictatorship that has never in its existence respected human &amp; business rights. This disgusting system that kept Ukraine &amp; keeps other countries in a vassal state status &amp; attacks them when they try to liberate themselves. Disgusting.
1590248519134498816,Wed Nov 09 07:42:47 +0000 2022,@zerohedge Russia should help SAA here to free their lands from invaders who occupy their territory. Wonder why this is not already done in response to US behaviour in Ukraine.

No way around it all on purpose

1590248467255156739,Wed Nov 09 07:42:34 +0000 2022,@ABCmediawatch News Corp is rabidly biased. And it is insidious. Often bias happens very effectively through silence. They don't report on the Ukraine which is the biggest most cataclysmic story at present. Just look at the BBC etc
1590248456207360001,Wed Nov 09 07:42:32 +0000 2022,I fear that another Trump term will be a disaster. If Putin is still there he will play this idiot like an violin stroking his ego. He’ll withdraw his support for Ukraine putting pressure on them to surrender. This will have severe consequences for EU &amp; rest of the world #auspol
