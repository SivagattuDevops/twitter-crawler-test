Why defend Nazi if they play no role in #Ukraine and are so insignificant unless.... They are the backbone of the #Ukranian military and main force in a fight.

Russia US and UK promised to honor Ukraine borders and sovereignty and provide Ukraine security in the Budapest Memorandum treaty of 1994. Guess which country is violating the treaty?
