Do you know that the nearby Melitopol and Kherson city had virtually no damage or deaths back in March/April because Azov fighters were NOT in those cities to destroy them via engaging Rus forces in a heated urban battle?

Also I think you‚Äôre forgetting that there are other gas sources which already have been accessed. Also long term orcs guaranteed their demand not to come from Europe (about time).
