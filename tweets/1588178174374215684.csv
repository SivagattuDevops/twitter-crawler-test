1588177802905255936,Thu Nov 03 14:34:29 +0000 2022,@AmoneyResists I continue to remind myself of this timeless truth:  everything ended for dfg's transnational crime syndicate posing as an administration on 8-8-22. That's the long &amp; short of it. The only thing they have now is violence so extreme we cave. That's it. Just like Ukraine.

Support the people of Iran.
Nayak and Mojahedin Khalq are not representatives of Iranian people.
