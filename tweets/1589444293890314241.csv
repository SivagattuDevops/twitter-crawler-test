1589443730590691328,Mon Nov 07 02:24:50 +0000 2022,Putin's threat that nuclear weapons could be used to strengthen Russia's control over the  illegally annexed parts of Ukraine is being taken seriously by health authorities both in Ukraine and abroad. This threat can be removed only by elimination of Russia's nuclear arsenal.

1589443716632449026,Mon Nov 07 02:24:47 +0000 2022,@thephilosotroll I think his approach is that violence in general is bad. Obviously an aggressor needs to be stopped and the innocent defended.
