1589982705550528515,Tue Nov 08 14:06:32 +0000 2022,So the last trip to #Ukraine for this year is rather short; I'm picking up Ira and sending whatever you donate to our driver Sasha who is joining the forces. Gas money + essential non-military goods. Thank you!
1589982705353388033,Tue Nov 08 14:06:32 +0000 2022,"@PoliticusSarah That's a misrepresentation. There are many who don't support aid for Ukraine who are not MAGA - and many who are MAGA still support aid for Ukraine.

The point is that NATO damaged global security when they forced Russia's hand.

1589982693781299200,Tue Nov 08 14:06:29 +0000 2022,@BetteMidler There's damn near 100 billion that went to Ukraine that the Dems could have put back into ss.  If that were so important they would have done that rather than choose the flavor of the week of money wasting.

My assumption is that they were/are under equipped to maintain momentum."

1589982674567200768,Tue Nov 08 14:06:24 +0000 2022,@StedWoo One could see that mighty Russia is in trouble when they are reverting to World war I tactics placing barriers(Dragon teeth) and mining defense lines while in trenches. Ukraine should be proud of its army for its accomplishments on the battlefield. No compromise with such losers.
