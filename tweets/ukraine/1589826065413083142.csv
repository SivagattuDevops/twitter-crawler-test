1589825400414560257,Tue Nov 08 03:41:27 +0000 2022,And there you have it. The constant public pressure and Congressional investigations into the very obvious ties between Donald Trump and Russia prevented the compromised president from providing overt assistance to Putin in Ukraine.

1) Did Russia interfere in the 2016 election? 

Yes.

2) If Putin had POTUS in his pocket, why didn‚Äôt he invade Ukraine when trump was president?

Public pressure is effective and your voice makes a difference."
