Ukraine started shelling the DPR and LPR in 2014, killing ethnic Russians. The current Russian operation minimized civilian deaths to a level unseen in modern warfare, acting almost entirely in self defense"

Do the russians limit themselves to defense?"

Russia is killing civilians including children and pregnant women for NO REASON. Anyone that does NOT support Ukraine supports communism and Russia by default.
