Expert work. https://t.co/Wzh2tgZyqh"

Obviously a cunning plan to lure Ukraine into a trap. 😉 I suspect they don’t have enough regular troops to hold Ukr back and defend a city. Winter is coming and keeping a city warm and fed will be a massive task in a war zone.

Did a single Republican run on immigration restriction, stopping funding to Ukraine, or addressing the issue of out of control Black crime?"
1590370566552563719,Wed Nov 09 15:47:45 +0000 2022,@ChaloubMega @Plague_Cz @WarMonitor3 This is true. Kherson is a better place for attrition. They'll blow the bridges and that front will cease to exist. If Ukraine gets a way to achieve longer range fires though... they may be able to do some of the same in the south.  Especially if kherson is completely clear.
