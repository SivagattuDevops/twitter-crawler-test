The advertising he is getting far out does costs. It's only 7months! Fair enough after &gt;2+ years!

The Russians are just protecting their boarder after a US backed Ukrainian revolution and 8 years of Ukraine shelling eastern Ukraine including boarder towns.

You think US would have waited 8 years if Mexico did the same?"
