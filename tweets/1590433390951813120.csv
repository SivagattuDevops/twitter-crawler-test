It seems more like the strategic goal is Moscow.ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

They‚Äôre already setting up defense positions way deep in Crimea. That surely helps the morale of RuAF soldiers hundreds of kilometers ahead- Sulks to be a Russian soldier right now."

If they took larger losses, they could claim it was Ukraine and use it to justify attacks with horrible weapons. History suggests being very wary of Putin and Russia at this point"

Here we elected a pedo liar to President, plenty of liars to office, yet comply again when they lie next election cycle.

1590432952777080832,Wed Nov 09 19:55:39 +0000 2022,@Jonathan_K_Cook I think you and he have a different view of how to get peace in Ukraine. I think his experience of dealing with Russia is more relevant than yours.
