Vladimir Putin invaded Ukraine this year. Since then we have rushed $800B to Ukraine in 2022.

Has the government given seven times that to US children this year?"

This war is an act of aggression and against international law. The war itself is a war crime. Ukraine is the victim here, not Russia. Nobody forced Russia to invade, nobody forced them to bombard kindergartens.

Being with Russia would be morally wrong."
