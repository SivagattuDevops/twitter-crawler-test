Why don't they put the interests of the nation and the people first before doing stupid things like supporting the Ukraine war.  Poor thinking is the shortest path to extinction.

It does not justify England now attacking &amp; ‚Äútake back land‚Äù that was historically theirs due to a colonial past.

Yet this is the justification #PutinWarCriminal uses in Ukraine - like Hitler did in Austria &amp; Poland.
