That means a free Ukraine and everyone goes his own way making something of their countries instead on this nonsense in 2022. You don't invade and kill your neighbours. Ever. Dot end of the line.

Fits larger pattern of US unilateral abrogation, e.g. ABM Treaty &amp; Open Skies, then whining about Russian non-compliance."
