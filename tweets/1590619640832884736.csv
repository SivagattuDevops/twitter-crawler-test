Ironically, the only thing standing in the way of a violent war with China is escalating Trump’s trade war — which may yet be revealed as the wisest policy of the last decade."

But he panicked about Covid, created a storm in a tea cup about a mild virus so China locked down, when Xi had wanted to ignore Covid. Then Xi cynically got his revenge 'helping' the West with Lockdown &amp; mitigations."
