Once in Turkey and twice in Belarus. All three were mute sine Russia would not budge on its unacceptable terms. Russia knew Ukraine wouldn't accept terms but did it anyway just to say it did.

Russia invaded Crimea in 2014 &amp; stayed. They’ve invaded east Ukr in 2022 &amp; think they’re going to stay. If they do, they’ll invade again."
