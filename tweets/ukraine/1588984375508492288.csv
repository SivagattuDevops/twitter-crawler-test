If you think 40yr high inflation while we send over 60 billion dollars to Ukraine is fine, you aren‚Äôt thinking clearly. We had energy independence, no wars, a booming economy, and no wide open borders. Safer streets without cashless bail."

If you live near a hospital and then move further away, and someone shoots your foot (the invasion of Ukraine driving up oil prices), you can blame the person for shooting you even though it takes you longer to go to the hospital."
