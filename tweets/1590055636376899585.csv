Ukraine is personal obsession of putain and his ppl.
UA ppl wanted to join EU. ruZZia used their puppet yanukovych to cancel this deal and sell UA to ruZZia."

You argue that Russia simultaneously supports Nazis (which is bad) and bans Nazism (which is bad). I agree that there are issues with the law but to say that there is moral equivalence with the Ukraine where government militia wave swastikas.. ?
