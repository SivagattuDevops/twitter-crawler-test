It is that the U.S. is slipping into Republican fascism, where the Putin groupies like MJT will dictate policy, regardless."

That's one of the key stepping stones to supporting Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Elon interactions with the far right is much easier going than his intersections on the left.

That, combined with a bigger force of civilian reserves, could make the cost of an invasion too high for China.

Once russia attacks Ukrainian power plants, Ukraine should retaliate in-kind.
Bring the war to russia. Trigger an uprising, or at least, break their will to stay in Ukraine."
