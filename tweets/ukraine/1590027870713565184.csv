The Schutzmannschaft Battalion 118 (western Ukrainian unit) massacred my people in Lahoysk. If you glorify Vasiura a killer of my people you are a Nazi
1590027533407629314,Tue Nov 08 17:04:39 +0000 2022,Re USA mid terms you just got to pray that American voters see sense &amp; vote for the Democrats because God help us all if the Republicans win the country will go back to the 19th century and they'll start backing Sauron invasion of Ukraine

1590027486171385858,Tue Nov 08 17:04:28 +0000 2022,@Podolyak_M It is all for the benefit of the internal audience of Russia! They want desperately to prove that they are losing to the US and therefore keep repeating that they will negotiate with US. Just goes to prove the point that Ukraine has been making all this while.
1590027485038620676,Tue Nov 08 17:04:28 +0000 2022,@Podolyak_M I don‚Äôt understand how they are so wrong with mathematics. It doesn‚Äôt matter if Republicans control both the house and the senate. With roughly half of the republicans and mostly all of the democrats supporting aid to Ukraine nothing will change in Russian favor.

Well from what we know it is."
