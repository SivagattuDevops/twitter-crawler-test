Why in God's name would Russia use the nukes against Ukrainians? They have 4 times smaller population. US desperate to stop things from unfolding.

Yes the Russians were lacking drones initially. They adapted at wharp speed. They are now getting STARTED in this respect in Ukraine.

Speaking about Iran, though: 
Does Iran not want to destroy Israel and Jews?
Does Iran not deny the Holocaust?
