Do you want Ukraine to be aligned with a power that has committed atrocities on this scale?"

1589217408790966274,Sun Nov 06 11:25:31 +0000 2022,@BridgetCT19 @ToombsToni @Liz_Cheney I disagree. Russians today under Putin are freer to speak critically of the government than they ever have been in my lifetime. Putin enjoys popularity in Russia and is a moderating influence in this European crisis. The only one's approaching evil in Ukraine is the US and UK.
