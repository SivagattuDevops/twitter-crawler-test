And it was Trump who shipped actual weapons to Ukraine, unlike Obama-Biden who shipped non-military aid. When Russia invaded in 2022, the Trump weapons are what stopped Russia until more aid arrived."

The US and UK made him act like Ukraine could join NATO which he chafed at.

Then they burnt his political capital by cutting him off at the knees when he tried to negotiate a peace deal."
