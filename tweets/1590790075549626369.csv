But now that the Russians control the nuclear plant, who is the party still shelling the plant from a long distance?
Surely it’s not Russia targeting their own soldiers there. Ukraine is doing it. They don’t care about the danger either."

The Russians started the conflict in the Donbas in 2014 and escalated it in 2022. They created their own reason for invasion."

If I was Ukraine, I would not want to go into an 8-year slug-fest with the Russians, not in a war of annexation. I'd want it over by summer 2023"
