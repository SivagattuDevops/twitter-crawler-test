1591089157904150530,Fri Nov 11 15:23:10 +0000 2022,This is what confuses me with conservatives at times. How is Zelenskyy a warmonger when Putin is the one who invaded the sovereign nation Ukraine? Do y'all simply even ignore voices like Trump who aren't RINOs? Trump also condemns Putin's war crimes? https://t.co/AhYSQQArIj

I think south will have better weather for offensive operations before the end of the year (drier, less mud). So, Zaporizhia with the rested Kherson forces."

This winter it will be costly to sustain those 10s of thousands of poorly equipped troops and far better that this be Russias problem than Ukraine‚Äôs problem.
