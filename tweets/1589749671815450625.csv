1589749324489318400,Mon Nov 07 22:39:09 +0000 2022,"@Ranierose17 @mawtaverse @RoninTrebuchet @Teoyaomiquu Right now it is a crime in Russia to voluntarily surrender, so in order to encourage more Russians to surrender Ukraine has promised not to forcibly return those who voluntarily surrender. My guess is most or all of these people will remain in captivity until after the war."

Soldiers from the ""USA"" and ""Europe"" will have to stop

 Stopping Western aid to ""Ukraine"" insures our sons and daughters will once again die on European battlefields.

It's a Nation (State/People/Territory) which is suffering a REAL HOSTAGE SITUATION.
