Also, talk of negotiations is cheap. It's their content that matters."

If you were genuinely about to get 300k more guys, leaving 15k grunts in Kherson to maintain your bridgehead would be worth the cost in lives - especially given the costs you would impose on Ukraine to take it. Look how Ukr shrugged off Mariupol losses."

Plus they regain control of a logistic hub. It‚Äôs a major setback. Psychologically as well as on the ground. I see nothing positive in the retreat.
