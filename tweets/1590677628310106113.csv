1.  Acted as a foreign agent pushing Russian propaganda about Ukraine.   

2.  Acted as a foreign agent for China, pushing Chinese propaganda on Taiwan. 

3. Bought a $15B company for $44B, and is turning it into a $5B company. 

4.  Backed the GOP."

The peoples of the U.K. are really going to suffer badly. Sanctioning Russia was the most stupid thing that Boris Johnson did. You’ve sent billions in money and weapons to Ukraine. Stupid!!
