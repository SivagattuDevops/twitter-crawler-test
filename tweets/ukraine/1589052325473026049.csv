It will be seen and (rightly!) described as a betrayal of Ukraine. Everyone who will vote ""no"", knows Russia is doing this as a PR stunt and the result would be negative regardless. Might as well stand with Ukraine."

What should they concede? Ukraine already publicly stated they'd forgo NATO membership. What else? Give Putin Ukrainian land &amp; people? Piss on that.
