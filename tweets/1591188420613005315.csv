If this is happening, the city must be closed and every person moving in or out must be checked.
But most importantly: does Ukraine still have a civil registry of Kherson, with all the names of the citizens? 1/➡️

1591188096917204992,Fri Nov 11 21:56:19 +0000 2022,@BrianJBerletic Consider doing an episode on the European Security Framework proposed by RF. It would help think about post-Ukraine.

For me the context of that war includes Kuwait. So many people dismiss little Kuwait in the same way they try to dismiss Ukraine.

They are on the ropes and must not be allowed to rebuild for a re-match. This is when it must be decided.
