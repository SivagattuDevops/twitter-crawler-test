Not a diss on Ukraine; that's just who runs the scam. They get married to some loser and bleed him dry for the guys they're really with."

I wish more people knew about it but that was done by a communist government under Stalin who was if you want to look at nationality, Georgian. It wasn't  a Russian killing of Ukrainians, it was the USSR killing Ukraine"
