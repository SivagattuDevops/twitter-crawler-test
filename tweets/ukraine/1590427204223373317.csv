Gogol) is also an explanation why to the russian propaganda machine it MUST be Nato troups fighting in Ukraine, because allegedly Ukrainians JUST ARE NOT ABLE to stand up to russians.

1590426845215760384,Wed Nov 09 19:31:23 +0000 2022,@BobJone13984659 No such option in this war. You either support Ukraine and condemn russians or you support russians who commit the genocide of Ukrainians - Francis chose to support russians on behalf of the entire Catholic Church. The question is - why do Catholics stay silent?

1590426818674556928,Wed Nov 09 19:31:16 +0000 2022,"@rochowanski Nothing very glamorous about the Russian shambles in Ukraine. Putin's failure genuinely to mobilize the Russian people behind the war indicates I think that even in Russia, much of this militarism is just posing."
