We, the people, are NOT committed to the dirty dealings of Ukraine and Hunter Biden. 
The Biden family wants to pay hush money- that's their business.

That‚Äôs the chamber GOP is most likely to take and party leadership chooses what gets voted on. House GOP leadership want to quit supporting Ukraine; GOP moderates will have no power to force a vote.
