I am sure that Russian youngsters prefer this alternative #NoWar"

I can bet it that Ukrainian top officials are going to be way richer than they were thank you the money from west. When u add fuel(west financial support), the fire(Ukraine) continues. Why go for peace then?"

Since the tragic fall of Diway (AKA ""Jonathan Tseng"" and ""Tseng Sheng-kuang""), an Indigenous brave warrior of Taiwan who fought for Ukraine's freedom, the #wumao-sphere has been sending disinfo about his personal issues at home.
Keep this in mind, and start bonking."

Erase it from the map.  Putin has repeatedly broken treaties.  NATO was no threat, and Ukraine wasn't joining NATO.

Putin won't negotiate and keep his word."
