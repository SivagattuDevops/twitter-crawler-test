They evacuated the entire city and the past 2 weeks I saw them bringing in fortress equipment and digging trenches, then Ukraine starts the long awaited offensive and they just leave?"

Sure on the frontline under constant shelling these conditions are ever-present on both sides. The majority of Ukraine is fine, except for Russian missle attacks, but these can only disable power grids temporarily."

1590412647479902208,Wed Nov 09 18:34:58 +0000 2022,"Ah yes, America, which -- while piously denouncing supposed Russian plans to use tactical nukes in Ukraine -- works overtime to prevent the idea of banning nukes altogether, from ever becoming popular.

And we think this country is for peace. Puh-LEASE.

- The Russian army does not leave Kherson üá∫üá¶

She was KNOCKED out of Kherson by the Defense Forces of Ukraine.

It was knocked out with heavy battles, losses, methodically gnawed through the enemy‚Äôs defenses, work on crossings, hard &amp; bloody military labor.‚Äù https://t.co/IoueKHY0Z9"

But then he became a traitor for the sake of the promised benefits and a comfortable chair. What is heroism?"

A Kalibr missile costs $6.5 for Russia to make, and they are having huge problems making new ones as they are heavily sanctioned.With respect to weapons and support to Ukraine from the US. Almost everything has been given to them.Not a loan. Poor Russia vs the West"
