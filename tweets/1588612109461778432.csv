That's how the nuclear provision of Russia's defense doctrine will be triggered. Kherson will be nuked soon after Ukraine recaptures it.

You cannot seriously expect Russia to leave these territories, knowing that Ukraine is going to join NATO in the future and continue their contant attacks on the liberated areas. To leave them landlocked will be more secure for Russia."

1) Ukraine is the front line for democracy. Of course we supported the protests against Yanukovych after he sided with Putin.

2). Democracy and freedom, higher gas prices, or Autocracy, limited freedom, lower gas prices. Ukraine chose FREEDOM!"
