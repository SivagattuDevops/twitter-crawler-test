The Senate is still strongly in support of Ukraine. The House could be problematical if pressure is applied. Time will tell.

Russia is not likely to launch because they know we would do the same. Nobody wins with that. We are safer if Russia loses against Ukraine. It would help if you were more concerned about the fascist Right.
