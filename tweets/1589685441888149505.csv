1589685136194703360,Mon Nov 07 18:24:06 +0000 2022,Ukraine and some others have observed that Russian actions in Kherson may be intentionally trying to lay a trap. But I think the broader macro-campaign of Russia has entered into the ranks of absolute disaster and I don't know how they will redeem themselves.

But for sure we knew this was supposed to be a ""quick win"" for Russia but the war had dragged on,and today Russia is mobilising hundreds of thousands,which also indicates their losses are in thousands"

The suffering I see and read about is in my thoughts every day and I think the west ought to do more to stop this.
