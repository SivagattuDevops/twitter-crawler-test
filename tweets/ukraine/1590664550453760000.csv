Price includes damages and returning Ukrainian citizens home. We also can swap PoWs. Russia started the war. Russia must leave. And it always has the possibility to just leave

Attacks were not coordinated. Putin seems to have taken command of the entire army which is what the tsar did."

I‚Äôd be very cautious as to the reason why Putin is doing this üëÄ
