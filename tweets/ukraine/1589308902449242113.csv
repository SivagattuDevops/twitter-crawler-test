Media humanized Ukraine and portrayed Russia as The Empire. None of this is bad, just saying that this is probably why you feel that way."

Hows about: proposing Ukraine agrees to splits with the Russian culture regions if the balance of Ukraine is provisionally accepted into the EU? With the UK.

All the Donbas wanted was a sessesion. They could have help referendum for them but instead decided to kill them. This gave room for Russia to step in. Ukraine gov is at fault too.

The reality is Ukraine &amp; its supporters are in danger of ""over-playing"" their hands here. After mid-term, Biden Admin will not be able to do much. That is just the political reality. You face to find a solution or turn back &amp; blow gains."

We don't know how much aid they send because, in agreement with UKR, ITA don't want to publish their contributions. Other countries like Finland have the same arrangement."

Ukraine is a situation that surely needs a peaceful solution. US and NATO have gone to Russia’s borders but that doesn’t excuse putin’s actions. Peace surely happens through negotiation.

This wasn’t and hasn’t been about NATO. Just listen to Putin talk about Russia and Ukraine being “one people”. He is trying to recreate former Soviet glory. https://t.co/TuaX6DHBJU
