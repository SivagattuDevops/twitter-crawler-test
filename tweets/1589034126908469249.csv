The US spend a trillion dollars in Afghanistan and had thousands of soldiers there and a shit ton of equipment too. There is currently not one US soldier in Ukraine. Stop bullshitting.

The invasion via the channel is an illegal incursion and our own spineless Gov and process’s  are just allowing it to happen. One simple rule “ apply from first safe country” can’t do that ?
