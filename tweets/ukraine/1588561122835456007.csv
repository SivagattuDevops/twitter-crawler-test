When I searched the EISD library catalogue, there were zero books about Vladimir Putin.

They have been making millions of Ukrainians homeless/countryless. They attacked and murdered civilians. They made a lot of war crimes in territories they occupied. US must do the right thing.

Russia was minding its own business when the US helped to overthrow the Ukrainian government friendly to Russia in 2014. And then proceeded to send weapons to Nazis in Ukraine to kill Russians in the Dombas for 8 years."
