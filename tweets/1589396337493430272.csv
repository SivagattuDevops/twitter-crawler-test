The world admires your bravery, your cleverness, your tenacity and your fearlessness as you defend your homeland. You have pulled off a remarkable rebuff of Putin‚Äôs troops in spite of the obstacles. Slava Ukraini! üíã"

We all know Russia is defending itself from the threat of that aggression. https://t.co/FW7tTSESKW"
