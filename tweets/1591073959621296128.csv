Many thought overt weapon supplies would provoke Russia or give the invasion justification. When the war came, the West and most of the establishment gave a blank cheque to Ukraine. Why insult Allies now?"

Instead of bla bla bla, 

do the same as you did when Russia occupied Ukraine, killed Ukrainians and destroyed Ukrainian cities.
