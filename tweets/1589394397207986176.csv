But as puppets always do...talk the talk but can't do anything without his handlers approval. Zelensky was Ihor's puppet but was hijacked by the Anglo-Americans. Keep your puppet and sink the Ukraine ship.
1589393918806085632,Sun Nov 06 23:06:54 +0000 2022,Interesting to note that your man Johnson can go jogging off to Ukraine and promise ¬£54 million pounds of further support but cannot intervene in the cost of living crisis - that needs the new PM in post.

They are and will continue to escalate the border dispute in Ukraine and will draft your children and risk a nuclear exchange. Vote red to stop this insanity"

1589393880860209152,Sun Nov 06 23:06:45 +0000 2022,@apmassaro3 Oh there will surely be an accountability. Good luck to the West convincing any country for nuclear disarmament after they see how it worked for Ukraine. What a lack of leadership. History repeats itself: Good times create weak men. Thats exactly how advanced civilizations die.

1589393863021514752,Sun Nov 06 23:06:41 +0000 2022,@GerardAraud Oh really. And why would that be then? Ukraine wasn't a member of NATO. We rely on the good nature of the RAF and R.N to protect us. Russia would use Ireland as a pawn if it had to and continually bullies Ireland because we have no military treaties with other nations.
