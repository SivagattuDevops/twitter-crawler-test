Although quite horrendously, I'm sure Putin's illegal invasion has created a load of nutters in Ukraine, absolutely determined not to let Hitler 2.0 walk all over them."

Hesitation all along in the White House has been Jake Sullivan using his power over Biden to not be so helpful with UKR.  The Pentagon generals know the real danger, but Jake Sullivan is a David Sacks, Tulsi Gabbard fan selling out Ukraine &amp; a very cold man. https://t.co/oPNqyO95gt"
