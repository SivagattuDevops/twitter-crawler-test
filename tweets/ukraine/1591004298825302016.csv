1591003889649713152,Fri Nov 11 09:44:21 +0000 2022,@maria_drutska Have there been any initiatives from the Russians (on the right-bank) to surrender? So that their lives are spared and Ukraine can seize this territory more easily?

Ukraine - Russians retreating leaving devastation behind, Americans sending missiles to down Iranian drowns, others sending arms and doing training, winter coming on top of other worries for Russian conscripts, now hungry, tired, cold and worst to come."

Now, they‚Äôre celebrating Russian withdrawals like they‚Äôre a victory. Complete denial."
