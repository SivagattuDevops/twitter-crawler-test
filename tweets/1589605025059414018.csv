Russia has a Nazi problem orders of magnitude greater than any other county.

Ukraine does not."

As to who dropped the ordinance, it could be Syrian Air Force but I'd strongly suspect Russia. They were the ones blaming everyone else and they're the ones using unguided ordinance in both Syria and Ukraine.

Hope that helps!"
