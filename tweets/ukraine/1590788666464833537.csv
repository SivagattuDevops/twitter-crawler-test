He literally has no shame because he knows he'll never have to answer for his families nonsense
1590788394292228096,Thu Nov 10 19:28:03 +0000 2022,"@RitaMar93112090 @robredotruthe @cheshirecat847 @KyivIndependent Rita, if Ukraine is “neutralizing Russia” as you say, all Russia has to do is return its troops back to Russia and quit attacking with missiles.  Also, I have seen beautiful things in Russia - unfortunately, they (Russians) are destroying themselves."
1590788385802752004,Thu Nov 10 19:28:01 +0000 2022,…and both parties are in on it. This election got in the way of their “Ukraine Money Laundering War” and both sides are neck deep in that…mark my words…may never come out…but it is what it is. https://t.co/0JHI4oclJ0

In 6 mo, Ukraine would have started new war in Donbas, and Russia's choice would have been sit quietly and look weak, while Ukraine retakes Donbas and then joins Nato. Or fight, and still be hit with all same sanctions as now."

1590788371739475968,Thu Nov 10 19:27:57 +0000 2022,@CentristaGril @WarMonitor3 yes yes yes !!! That is key to stop the resistance before they cross to the left bank and then they will be spread out according to Putin to fight in other areas of Ukraine  Is is there any news that they’ve taken out the ferries?????
1590788368904126464,Thu Nov 10 19:27:57 +0000 2022,@RWApodcast if they care for casualties so much what the fuck is the pointless push in bakhmut and how did thousands non trained conscripts found heir way into Lyman? if Russia cares so much about casualties just leave Ukraine.
1590788368207863808,Thu Nov 10 19:27:57 +0000 2022,"@BritishWatchman @AlanFresco4 @bradyafr Ukraine doesn't seem to be attacking the retreating Russians. at least i haven't seen anything yet that would imply they are.

many have said Ukraine should use this opportunity to inflict heavy casualties(it might shorten the war..)"
1590788366161022977,Thu Nov 10 19:27:56 +0000 2022,"@RWApodcast Russia will never be able to go into offensive in Ukraine. Ukr will just keep on getting more and more and better weapons and Russia has nothing to counter that, other than nukes."
1590788361434075136,Thu Nov 10 19:27:55 +0000 2022,Thai Foreign Minister Don Pramudwinai and I met in Phnom Penh to discuss Russian aggression against Ukraine. I briefed him in detail on all the suffering that Russia’s war has inflicted upon the Ukrainian people. I urged Thailand to spare no effort in defending the UN Charter. https://t.co/ezDpeYowrC
1590788358665801728,Thu Nov 10 19:27:54 +0000 2022,"@bono_mette @stribe39 @WarMonitor3 Even if we lost Bakhmut, Ukraine has done their job there. It's an ego piece that they've spent far too long attacking,  and sending more troops to die there will only weaken Russia more."

You're a Jewish woman living in USA but you state that USA, Israel and Ukraine are the most evil countries because of wars, Nazis, etc. But you love Russia and especially the Wagner group, both full of Nazis. You must be the most pathetic troll there is 😂"
