The lend-lease-act allowed US to deliver 1000s of tanks to SU thus making them successful in the war against nazi germany. Some Millions of Ukraine died by Stalins planned genocide in the 30s, the so called Holodomor. History  repeats."

They killed up to 45 people, and no one's ever been prosecuted. This marked the beginning of Ukraine's civil war.
