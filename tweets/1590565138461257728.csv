1590564333510983680,Thu Nov 10 04:37:43 +0000 2022,@DanLamothe If Ukraine was suffering anywhere near 1:1 KIA ratio Russia would be throwing their troops into the meat grinder and winning territory. I bet it's more like 4:1+ in Ukraine's favor. Did being around Trump rot Millet's brain?

Russian ppl had not known Putin at all before Yeltsin made him the Rus President in 1999."
