In regards to nuclear aspect though as soon as Ukraine pumped up the nato volume it brought agreement to mind right away, and when parallel draft treaties were sent just before the military action, Russia was basically told to piss off https://t.co/DmC0Qisa7J"

Small groups of men with swastika-flags exists un every fucking country on earth. It does not mean the entire country is nazis. Its beyond stupid to feed the russian troll narrative of that being the case when it is clearly not. Think before you post.

After the breakup of the USSR Crimea became part of Ukraine by Russia‚Äôs own agreement. Crimea paid taxes to Ukraine &amp; was under Ukrainian defense from 1990 to 2014. Those historical claims are as wrong as Quebec being France or Northern Ireland being Ireland.

Our government is spending our money to propagandize us to waste billions in Ukraine and escalate towards nuclear war.

We are being lied to constantly.
