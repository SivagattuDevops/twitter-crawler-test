She's unlucky, it's true... but it's the Left's fault anyway. Never shoud've gotten involved in Ukraine. Now EVERYBODY is paying the price (The USA, Europe... and of course precious precious miss Griner...)"

1590421277591805952,Wed Nov 09 19:09:15 +0000 2022,@elonmusk There are all these people who have Ukraine flags in their handle and say things about their political opponents which are projection.   I‚Äôm not sure how to fix but it‚Äôs an odd bug.

1590421271560716288,Wed Nov 09 19:09:14 +0000 2022,"@BozoVinny @mrfrankthetank_ If killing people is wrong, then why do you support the war? I'm against. I believe the war could have been prevented by simply acknowledging that many Russian speakers in Eastern Ukraine don't support the Ukrainian nationalists whom their grandparents fought against during WWII."

1590421269249687554,Wed Nov 09 19:09:13 +0000 2022,WELL DONE UKRAINE. Yesterday was a terrible day for Trump and an even more terrible day for his running mate Vlad. https://t.co/3Ln4WJSAjM
1590421263104999424,Wed Nov 09 19:09:12 +0000 2022,Also less worried about aid to Ukraine being cut.

If there is one thing clear in this war is that #Ukraine, with the help of the #US and #UK has a significant intel advantage over #Russia, so I‚Äôll bet they‚Äôll detect such a plan #Kherson https://t.co/1HVRsfvIyA"

Eventually you reach a point there's a point of diminishing returns with such trolls. Keep up the good fight!"

Russia says it is too.  Which fact is more factual?  Please explain since I'm taking you seriously a little while longer than most.
1590421244591374336,Wed Nov 09 19:09:07 +0000 2022,"@IuliiaMendel Caution needed as they will leave hidden mines. 
Perhaps Ukraine could fortify the other side of the Dnipro &amp; surround Kherson with prepared defence lines. Winter will be here soon &amp; come Spring, if there has still not been peace then Ukraine can renew its push to clear them out."
