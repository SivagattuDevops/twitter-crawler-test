1590851045672255488,Thu Nov 10 23:37:00 +0000 2022,@jakenos @lmpilots @Bruinsfan109323 You think the world will be safer when every other country without nukes watches the downfall of Ukraine and realizes that treaties aren't with the ink they are written with and the only things providing protection are building huge coalitions or obtaining nukes themselves?

Putin‚Äôs destructive carnage and power of weapons is causing the maximum destruction to Ukraine and not forgetting the millions of Ukrainian refugees including children that seek refuge in many foreign countries ever since this current Russian conflict
1590851023601635329,Thu Nov 10 23:36:55 +0000 2022,"@adamlikestocook @KyivIndependent @sharpndpensel No. Worried about Ukraine getting their land back &amp; then eliminating military targets in Russia, like ammo dumps &amp; staging areas. If they get to the border, they are going to need to eliminate stuff on the Russian side to secure the gain."
1590851003078873090,Thu Nov 10 23:36:50 +0000 2022,@KyivIndependent Lol. Are they thinking Ukraine will invade them? Pretty sure they are going to be plenty happy just driving the Russians from their territory. Including the Crimea
