1590872927402340352,Fri Nov 11 01:03:57 +0000 2022,@acoyne You should be wondering what PMs were funded by China and why our PM was aware of it and did nothing?

The point is by using ""necessitate"" you're being soft on China. Say it for what it is, don't frame it like it's something forced on them."

But adopting population control does not mean copying exactly all China did. There are ways to draft policies that address the goal and certain peculiarities, and are not as stringent."

1590872871873970176,Fri Nov 11 01:03:44 +0000 2022,@teddZINN @real_defender @POTUS How did Trump cost American lives? He called for a travel ban month before a single American died from Covid. Pelosi was hugging people maskless in China Town just to undermine Trump's covid protections. She sent a horribly wrong message at a critical moment.
1590872869008875520,Fri Nov 11 01:03:43 +0000 2022,"In July 2022 China had a covid vaccination rate of over 89% confirming what we now know that the #covidvaccines DO NOT prevent transmission. These ""vaccines"" are evolving into the new variants. ""Following the Science"" was playing God - it was never about your health.
