The conservative/low end projections do not even apply. Greater than 100 million overcount all since one-child, which means this is absolutely false."

It was planned 4 years ago but could not occur due to the unexpected election of Trump."

Exactly like we do to their elections. What u fail to mention is that they also proved Trump didn't collude with them and that Dems were behind the plot"
