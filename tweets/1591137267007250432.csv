You're of the party that calls your political opponents nazis &amp; then funnels taxpayer dollars to fund actual nazis in Ukraine. Isn't that how you ""peddles ugliness, hate, deception...""? Wasn't student loan forgiveness a deception?"

Your president begs for our money because your country is too weak to defend themselves. Eventually it will stop and you’ll have to protect yourselves. Poor pitiful Ukraine. Too weak to stand on their own 2 feet.

Now, after Russia's retreat, a huge outpouring of support for Ukraine. And that's with so much of the population having fled during nine months of war and ocupation.
