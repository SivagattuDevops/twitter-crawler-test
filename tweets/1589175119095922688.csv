And the Galizien has not commited war crime. They were formed between 1943 and 1944. They were crushed during the battle of Brody. After that they were transfered in Slovakia. And it's Lviv, not Lvov."

That makes no sense, Ukraine is a democratic and independent country, if Russia conquer Ukraine then they will invade Latvia, Estonia, Lithuania or Finland"
