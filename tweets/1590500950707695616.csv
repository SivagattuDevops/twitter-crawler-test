Everybody told him in February that he will end up here.
This is just the beginning. When Russians will find out THE TRUTH about Putin's ambition, they will take care of this MESS. How many Russians will need to die? https://t.co/6KykqmMacv"

That someone, anyone, thought this ceremony and video were impressive is an important statement about their situation.
