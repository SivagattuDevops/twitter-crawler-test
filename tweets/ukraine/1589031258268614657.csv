Risk of flank &amp; rear attacks but unlikely as mobiks generally without officers to direct them. Tighter thrusts also risk air/artillery vulnerable concentrations.

The CCP doesn’t have the balls to image Taiwan. They been saying that for a long time with no action. They know if they attack Taiwan they would be destroyed by everyone. The CCP makes more money making stuff
