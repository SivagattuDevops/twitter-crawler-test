I think Wallace gets it regarding the state of the Army but possibly needs to be more direct. I think we are currently kidding ourselves that we can replace mass with tech if Ukraine shows anything it‚Äôs that we need both
1588644443107643393,Fri Nov 04 21:28:45 +0000 2022,@squatsons @johndoe77973743 I hope with all my heart that Ukraine wins this war that putler needlessly started. And I‚Äôm grateful for the support that is being given to them. Whatever the politics in the background it would be disastrous for the world if they lose any land. Would prove that violence works.

Why? Because we had them, too, and he feared retaliation. Putin won't use nukes for the same reason.
Besides, supplying weapons creates good jobs for Americans.

Ukraine will win. Russia will be denazified.

The American people do not want war!
