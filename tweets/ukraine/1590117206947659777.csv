1590116865216778240,Tue Nov 08 22:59:38 +0000 2022,@spl_liff Russia sent like 200k troops in initially. Ukraine had around 800k at one point. The unlimited supplies is coming to an end &amp; the amount of fresh troops are eventually going to run thin. Any window for success for Ukraine is over now that Russia is adding more bodies imo
