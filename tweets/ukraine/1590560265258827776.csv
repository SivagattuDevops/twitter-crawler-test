Can't accept Ukraine has flaws.
Claims anyone who doesn't wholeheartedly believe everything good about Ukraine is a Russian bot.
Has made no argument to the contrary of what I said, just ""Russia worse""

You're the bot."

TBH I think Ukrainians maintain far better morale and optimism because they work themselves into a trance by constantly repeating meaningless slogans as though a mantra. Russians ponder and are therefore susceptible to GLOOM

If Putin goes to a full on complete mobilization the West can give Ukraine all the weapons they can handle but it eventually becomes a simple numbers game where Russia can just outlast Ukraine in the losses game
