They are in a war they didn‚Äôt want and people are dying there every day.

And we had WORLD PEACE. After Obama started seven wars. As a matter of fact, Putin was attacking Ukraine under Obama too. And attacking fracking and off shore drilling."

‚ÄúDo you know how much your administration have sent to Ukraine, mostly in military aid, over the last 8 months?

Over $60 billion.

That money should‚Äôve been used to make Americans lives easier &amp; cheaper this winter.‚Äù

We can see the effect of war in Ukraine with loses of civilian life and infrastructure. As we enter the full effects of Climate Change their will be conflicts.
