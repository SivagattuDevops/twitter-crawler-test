The talking head from United Nations said they’re in need of $6 billion to achieve that goal.

If Putin hadn't invaded Ukraine western nations would not have had that opportunity. Putin, as you, totally misjudged the situation. Putin literally did this to himself."

Of the 24+ million Soviet losses from 1940-45 much more than half were Russians. They will be OK. Ukraine on the other hand has even worse demographics and no economy.

Secret supertank T-80 turned out to be upgraded T-72. New planes full design faults like shaking Ka-52. Leaning on US for internet + satellite navigation.

Every normal person I know gives more of a damn about how much their groceries and gas costs compared to a bunch of spoiled elites getting their pristine floor stepped on or Ukraine getting invaded which isn't surprising at all.
