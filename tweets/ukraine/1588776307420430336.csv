I hope one day we will see Mrs Cheney run for the presidency. Victory to Ukraine 🇺🇦🇬🇧

It is true Bandera initially aligned with Hitler as did Stalin. None of this excuses Putin acting like Hitler!"

More weapons are being delivered to Ukraine and one commentator said that's why the Ukrainians have been holding their positions.

You hold onto the myth of Russian invincibility and Ukrainian weakness and refuse to accept the reality, which is that the invasion, so far, is a total failure. The West is not the same as it was in 2014; it will support Ukraine till the end. Victory is inevitable."
