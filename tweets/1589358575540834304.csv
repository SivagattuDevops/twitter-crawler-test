For example I have sent two generations to fight for European liberty. I didn't say I didn't support Ukraine I contradicted the contention it was for me. It's not.
1589358181234663424,Sun Nov 06 20:44:53 +0000 2022,@amanpour @senrobportman You do realize Ukraine will have to pay back the western nations for the munitions and support spent. War isn‚Äôt a charity. Plus military industrial complex benefits massively by arms being used and expended in conflict. It‚Äôs a for profit cause.

This is a mass genocide committed by Ukrainian nationalists against the Polish minority in 1943-1945 in the areas of eastern, pre-war Poland occupied by the Third Reich. The crime resulted in the deaths of some 100,000 Poles. https://t.co/e8AT6TvKwB"

1589358157121392645,Sun Nov 06 20:44:48 +0000 2022,Here we go. Time is up for the west to stomach this war. The cost is too much. Long Russian energy was always the play and we don‚Äôt have much of one at all. We are even talking about shelving the Sizewell C reactor. Am I missing something?  https://t.co/ZQXbkskrys

Putin should get the F out of Ukraine and save his peoples lives. Putin can‚Äôt do nothing. USA is sending weapons left &amp; right &amp; he knows it‚Äôs coming from a base in Poland. Why can‚Äôt he just attack it. You‚Äôre been fooled by Putin.
