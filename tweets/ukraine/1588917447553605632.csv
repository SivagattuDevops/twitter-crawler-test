You, like other ""American exceptionalists, seem to think that bcuz we don't ""support"" Ukraine we are Russian stooges. Many of us simply do not support war at all. I'm disappointed it came to this."

Does the fact that Russia has neo-nazi brigades within its country justify an illegal invasion on the grounds of ‚Äúdenazification‚Äù?"
