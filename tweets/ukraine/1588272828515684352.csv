I live in Serbia, we are neutral and you can see both sides. I strongly support Russia because of this and because the majority of humanity (88% minimum) supports it. https://t.co/WupHZ89K82"

The peace and love Democratic Party. Now the Democratic Party is about hate and war (Ukraine) and divisiveness. I wish there was a great moderate 3rd political party. Oh well.
