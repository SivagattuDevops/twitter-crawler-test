1589070007992201216,Sun Nov 06 01:39:48 +0000 2022,@LoriShemek Yes walking backwards is a big help in staying healthy. In china every morning there are people walking backwards for atleast 2-3 Kms bcoz there are parks designated for walking. In this country unfortunately we don't have sufficient number of parks designated for walking.
