Germany is the most ""green"" member with the HIGHEST power bills on Earth even BEFORE the Ukraine War! See Tweets👆

1589324513833283584,Sun Nov 06 18:31:06 +0000 2022,"Today Ukraine is right to reject false negotiations, which the Kremlin would see as a signal of weakness. Moscow has chosen the military force as the only language to speak to Kyiv."

1589324511521820672,Sun Nov 06 18:31:06 +0000 2022,"But now there must not be talks for the sake of talks. Since 2014 the Kremlin has violated all international norms, the Budapest memorandum, Russia – Ukraine bilateral treaty, even pro-Russian Minsk accords, and still  doubles down on military force."

1589324508581998592,Sun Nov 06 18:31:05 +0000 2022,"President Zelensky: 'We are ready for peace, for a fair and just peace.' That requires Russia to respect Ukraine's territorial integrity as well as fully compensate for the damage caused to Ukraine. 
At a right time that should be negotiated with the Kremlin. Putin or not."
1589324502043078659,Sun Nov 06 18:31:04 +0000 2022,Ukraine's unambiguous heroic stance in response to  Putin’s aggression is in the heart of the strong American and international support. This stance should continue to be realistic to maintain support and combat “Ukraine fatigue.”
1589324499337367552,Sun Nov 06 18:31:03 +0000 2022,"For Ukraine ""No negotiations with Putin"" is detached from reality as ""Start negotiations now."""

1589324497274179585,Sun Nov 06 18:31:03 +0000 2022,"@TakLitak @E_Lemmingway @Ambervilis @Guiller51363627 @apmassaro3 Other countries don’t idolize a Nazi collaborator as a “Hero” but Ukraine does. Prior to the US sponsored coup, the US even labeled Azov as a terrorist organization. Even the peace corps warns minorities to avoid Ukraine due to its Neo-Nazi beliefs."
1589324451241332736,Sun Nov 06 18:30:52 +0000 2022,@TimothyDSnyder Let's all remember that every year USA as a whole spends over 12 billion dollars on gift wrapping . Nobody needs this shit and it didn't destroy a single Russian tank or missile. Our help to Ukraine blows up the military of our sworn enemy and gives jobs to Americans. Win-win.
1589324449765285889,Sun Nov 06 18:30:51 +0000 2022,Some GREAT information in this video. I don't understand how these Democrats who are so bewildered over all these freakin Democrats! US Have LIED About Ukraine War” https://t.co/6c4D5dg7ou via @YouTube

Division ☑️
Drama ☑️
Culture wars ☑️
Undermined the populous faith in our elections ☑️
Kissed Trump's ass ☑️
Supporting the enemy, Russia over invaded Ukraine ☑️"
1589324446992433152,Sun Nov 06 18:30:51 +0000 2022,"Something to consider if Russian propaganda has you convinced that we we should stop helping Ukraine because it’s “too expensive.” 

Letting Russia support China in its efforts to overthrow the Western-led order - would be far more “expensive”. https://t.co/3bdovcfvz4"
