With only a thin majority, the GOP won't be able to muster the votes to put into question our unwavering support for the fight for democracy in Ukraine. Putin is crushed because the pro-democracy mid term results."
1590911279845511169,Fri Nov 11 03:36:21 +0000 2022,@slapi3451 @Al__Barratt @IAPonomarenko The usefulness of the lighter HIMARS has been very enlightening. That thing was built for speed. Including the length of time it takes to fire and move again. The sacrifice of the firepower has made it a more effective weapon in the Ukraine. Still the 12 M270s is nice to have.
