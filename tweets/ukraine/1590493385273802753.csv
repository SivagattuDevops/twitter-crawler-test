It would do nothing but provoke Ukraine and it‚Äôs allies to fight harder. Send two divisions of M1-A2 and a bunch of F-35s with contract pilots. That‚Äôs what a dirty bomb would do."

It is obvious when Russia invaded in Feb, they were dreadfully unprepared and unsure what to do. They have been hell bent on fighting this war on the cheap, with white gloves on.
