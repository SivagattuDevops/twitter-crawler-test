At some point the temperature increase reaches a practical maximum and further increases are so small they won't be noticed. Either India or China alone will produce enough co2 to get us there. It can't be stopped by the West."

1589326470991990784,Sun Nov 06 18:38:53 +0000 2022,"IMO, the lower risk trades are:
👉 long USD (short other currencies)
👉 and bearish US stocks after midterms/approaching cpi report

Higher risk trades:
👉 play china and oil cycles"

👉 USD is going back to a wrecking ball 
👉Yo yo for commities.  Current oil rip will be challenged with CPI report and much less Fed pivot hopium
👉 Bearish US stocks.  SPY cuts 3570 political support line
👉 China stocks yo yo-ing w/ hopium"

👉 China cannot afford high commodity inflation, so no pivot until US/europe demand dropping
👉 Hopium is to reduce/attract foreign capital.  CNY is weakening and hopium supports it"
1589326466172739585,Sun Nov 06 18:38:52 +0000 2022,"Fed Policy: IMO, rates higher than consensus.  Why?
👉 strong US econony, resistant to rate hikes, see linked thread
👉 midterm hopium is over
👉 realization: if there needs to be a recession get it done now
