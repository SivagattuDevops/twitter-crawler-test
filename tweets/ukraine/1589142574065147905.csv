Is that the threat to 'the west'? They've stripped the NATO borders of troops and equipment to obtain nothing extra in Ukraine."
1589141787792539649,Sun Nov 06 06:25:01 +0000 2022,I'm a reader of history; reading the day-to-day actions of WWII is horrifying but not as emotional (for me) as it is reading the day-to-day actions in Ukraine. So many similarities; the Russians are looting just like the Soviets looted as well as shooting deserters on-the-spot.
