China controls most of our GREEN energy and EV supply chain and therefore builds and sells these products to us …… yet they (and India, Russia, etc.) are NOT building Green.

They have regulations on what you can dump on soil how many more regulations do u want? Why would anyone run a company here less hassle to go to China

The sale of Hamburg Harbor strategic infrastructure to #China shows he hasn't learned one bit from #Merkel's disastrous policy that put Germany at #PutinHitler's mercy.

Do a little research about the Soviet Union (era early 1900s), the Bolshevik party and their revolution. Lenin, Marx, and Stalin got it wrong. If that's the kind of communist life you want then head to Cuba, Russia, China or North Korea."
