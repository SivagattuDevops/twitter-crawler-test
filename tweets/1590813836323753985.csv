Protestants only make up 2% of Ukraine's population so Russian's probably thought they'd get away with repressing them. It resulted in demos which they then repressed and has spiralled totally out of control https://t.co/WgNt1FlUDC

Russia is now alleging Ukraine has a dirty bomb. I would but be surprised if Russia planted a dirty bomb in previously occupied territory.
