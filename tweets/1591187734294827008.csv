I guess the only way to find out is to give it a try! You never know what might happen! Who thought Ukraine cld beat the tar out of the Russian Army? Only a few non-Ukrainians did, but they, &amp; the amazing people of Ukraine, were right."

1591187335655432192,Fri Nov 11 21:53:18 +0000 2022,The invasion was a wrong act of aggression violating Ukraine sovereignty and has caused huge damage to Ukraine and tremendous suffering of its people. It is only right that Russia gives back all it’s conquered land and pays for the reconstruction! https://t.co/rJr83oo8Zu

The times and context suck, but there's a lot more to it than labels"

Terrible to think about all the lives lost in this needless and barbaric war.

Salute!"

Shelling an enemy that can't really attack you, that isn't concentrated in your artillery range, isn't useful. They'll need to conserve it for other fronts. Undoubtedly they'll start shelling when Ukraine digs in"
