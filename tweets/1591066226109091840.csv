1591065905508876289,Fri Nov 11 13:50:47 +0000 2022,@WarMonitor3 Well you thought Ukraine could get there breaking through RU lines which technically didn't happen for the past 5 months. RU overcomplicated things and underestimated the enemy and now is forced to leave the city nut not because of military superiority of the enemy.

Interest rates so high some can't afford to buy the overpriced homes. STOP sending $ to Ukraine and u can't afford to misuse taxpayer's money
