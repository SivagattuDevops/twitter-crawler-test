The footage being show from Ukraine are individual citizen journalists sharing with the world. Get off your elitist horse. The video of Floyd wasn't some news employee. It was a citizen journalists who documented and shared

And, as I said, so far no evidence that any heavy fighting or shelling did even occur. But plenty of evidence of Ukraine liberating abandoned villages. Make of that what you will."
