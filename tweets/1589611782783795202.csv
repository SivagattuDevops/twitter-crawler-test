The US idea as a whole towards anybody of that belief is to he attacked in the streets. In Ukraine however nazis are funded and givin guns and permission to police thier area. If you want to make comparisons do your research first.

- main driver is too loose monetary and fiscal policy
- response came too late too little
- Don't overemphasize energy, Ukraine, inflation expectations and other secondary issues. focus on restoring the actual price stability."

The tweet mentioned a why: Russia are seeking to annihilate Ukraine. You asked for more or maybe other whys. But we are passed the whys. Russia has invaded and Ukraine is fighting for its survival. We can judge the actions instead."
