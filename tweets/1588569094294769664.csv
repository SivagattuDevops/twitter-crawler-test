However, he screwed it up with Covid vaccination mandates and the fact that people with side effects from it are still not helped. People lost their trust in democrats and will not vote for them. It's sad."

Biden started a war which required billionaire govt contractors who are actually friends with Biden to hire hundreds of thousands of people to make bombs and weapons of death to send to Ukraine.
1588568855370436608,Fri Nov 04 16:28:23 +0000 2022,Inflation is a global dynamic flowing from the Covid Pandemic and the Russian war on Ukraine. In other words; nothing to do with US economic policy but a lot to do with Trump's foreign policy of appeasement of Russian aggression.
