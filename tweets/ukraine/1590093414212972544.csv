1590093084582289408,Tue Nov 08 21:25:08 +0000 2022,"Absolutely harrowing scenes on #panorama We become desensitised all too quickly with war. The horror and needless destruction Putin has brought to Ukraine is truly shocking, evil little man. All the apologists for Russia should hang their heads in shame. #Ukraine #SlavaUkraini https://t.co/l54zCaOg6Q"

Russia should leave immediately, shouldn‚Äôt occupy an inch of Ukraine, need to pay war damage and war criminals must be tried. If he wins then the next battleground might be closer to us. Beat Putin now instead of in Poland or the Baltics. China is watching as well."
