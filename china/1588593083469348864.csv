Russia-Policy of Scholz is a dumpster fire. China-Policy is the same. His SPD-Party-Buddies have set a new standard for corruption.

The 60's are over, you've had plenty of time to enjoy your Capitalism from the cheap seats. My family in China, who suffered, until Capitalism was allowed, is about to suffer again under Xi's Maoist restrictions. Enjoy you fantasy."
