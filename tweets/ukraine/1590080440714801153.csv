And they just bomb the hell out of Russian positions. Sink Russia's navy in the Black Sea. Sanction Russia for the next decade until Tatarstan and Buryatiya become independent.

Did Trump strengthen or weaken NATO?

Comparatively, how much has Biden done for Ukraine &amp; NATO? ü§î"

Either way it's ignoring the point that giving aid to Ukraine is a massively better investment than either of those wars."

But Russians are humans. No better or worse than Ukrainians, Germans or whatever.

Make no doubt this is simply a renewables tax to recover the billions that are required to be spent to upgrade.
