1591067700595666946,Fri Nov 11 13:57:55 +0000 2022,@apmassaro3 This whole thing is a racket. Keeping Russian forces tied down is more important than winning a fight. Ukraine is again the center of a tug of war and they alone will suffer the human cost. Their dependence on funding will keep them tied down to the command of others.
