Nato expansionism is to blame.

They are and will continue to escalate the border dispute in Ukraine and will draft your children and risk a nuclear exchange. Vote red to stop this insanity"

Pogrom is a Russian word for attacks on Jews that began in Russian Poland and Ukraine. https://t.co/lpk7ohMKmV

They're not representative of the US in general and seem to be going out of their way for bad takes on the war.  NATO supplies will continue to go to support Ukraine.

He has sent $Billions overseas to arm Nazi paramilitaries in #Ukraine though &amp; push the world to the brink of WW3. So there's that accomplished.
