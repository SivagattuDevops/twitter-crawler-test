I loathe the invading Russians, yet cannot ignore the human tragedy these callow soldiers are sent into...and I can understand every action taken by Ukraine to eliminate them."

I can think of two well known pro-Ukr veteran accounts that have criticised this one of whom is a veteran of the war in Ukraine itself.
