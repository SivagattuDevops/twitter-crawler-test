The US has sent 18 billion dollars in aide, mostly in the form of weapons, vehicles, and other equipment. Even if it were 100% money. it'd be $60"

While your at it, read up on real freedom and those who would fight against people like Putin who attacks a country and tries to take them over. You think he will stop at Ukraine?"

More aid to Ukraine = less genocide. And the $ cost is negligible."
