I always said don't expect the shape of the war to stay the same - Ukraine has to be ready to adapt. Also we really should have been producing and supplying an equivalent so the Ukrainians can do the same back.

The West could just give the order to Zelensky's troops and they would move forward. Also US Defense Minister Austin went public about this recently.

1589661412032323585,Mon Nov 07 16:49:49 +0000 2022,@B_Proactv @fluxus2 I'd claim that being against aid to Ukraine is being for the war. Because Ukrainians aren't going to stop defending themselves. So not giving aid (that was promised to them when they gave up nuclear weapons) will just prolong the time it takes before they win or are genocided.
