If I have a veto at the UN, why would I ever invite a UN brokered deal that doesn't suit me. Abide by the principle 'if he can, he will'. Russia will get what it can. Crimea isn't going back to Ukraine."

1590107731826208770,Tue Nov 08 22:23:20 +0000 2022,@ivanastradner @officejjsmart @Kasparov63 I don't think the Russian people have the backbone to get rid of him. The majority show little moral courage.  Unlike the Ukrainians who have fought tooth and nail to have a  democracy through the years. That's why Ukraine will win this battle and the Russians will lose.

Living in the area doesn't mean you're well-versed in all the accents. Besides, it's irrelevant. As I plainly stated earlier, there're plenty of Russian-speakers in Ukraine."

The government keeps importing people from all over the World, Hong Kong, Afghanistan, Ukraine and of course hundreds of illegals allowed to stay.  I forecast this would happen."
