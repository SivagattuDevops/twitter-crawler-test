Long range weapons need to be in Ukraine's arsenal yesterday, to turn this retreat into a rout back to Russia."

If Ukraine had hundreds of them maybe its useful but they dont.
Most artillery is NOT with HIMARS.  Even with HIMARS you need the ISR in real time to target.
They're useful but not game changing."
