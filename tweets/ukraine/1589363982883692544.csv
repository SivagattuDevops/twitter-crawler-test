When the Russians are defeated they will serve no purpose. So they will eventually be purged. The new liberal multicultural and diverse Ukraine has no room for N*zis and bigots.

It’s not our war - there’s no treaty to protect Ukraine

One of the few good things about Bush 43 was he knew when to cut him loose.   The Biden approach in effect makes the border states de facto NATO members.
