He didn't do a proper Brexit. He didn't fix NI. He didn't fix the fishing. Wasted money on the wrong side in Ukraine. Etc... https://t.co/uCsfzzuGCn

The fact that we also decided to embark on such an economic shock as Brexit that then coincided with COVID and Ukraine showed the complete folly and cavalier risk that was taken.Brexit was also sold by a complete catalogue of lies.
