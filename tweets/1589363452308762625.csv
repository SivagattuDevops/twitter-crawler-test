Some in GOP must have concluded that public doubt on Ukraine is growing and there are votes to be won by opposing Democrats who want more military aid. https://t.co/b76MLzJWf2

When Balkans wanted to succeed they were allowed to and USA went in to ""peace keep"". Allowing them to break up stopped a Genocide. Not allowing Ukraine to break up is like any bad marriage only going to be bad for the kids."
