1589313293684207617,Sun Nov 06 17:46:31 +0000 2022,@SkyNews Reading this article makes one sick. In fact reading any report from western MSM about the war in Ukraine makes one sick. The demonizing of Russia &amp; Russians in particular Putin is extremely heart-wrenching. So much deep hatred had been planted in the minds of people in the West.
