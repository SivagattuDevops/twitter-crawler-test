And I already said that earlier about the convoy. The ""occupation"" would be the commonality here"

Ukraine installed NASAMs near these depots which makes less expensive subsonic cruise missiles ""more expensive"" due to the number needed to overwhelm the SAM. Hence, it's math. You need a salvo=more expensive!"

Throw away your weapons and go home!
And eat a hot dinner with the whole family.
Stay close to your family and lover who are worried about you.
The protagonists of Russia are you and your family. Not putin

Russia which violated the UN charter against taking territory by force and committing myriad war crimes.
 Detestable."
1588216395463942146,Thu Nov 03 17:07:50 +0000 2022,@AaronBlake How soon people forget that Ukraine is the third most corrupt country in the entire world. Plus it’s where both Republicans and Democrats launder their dirty money. How much of the billions that we sent went to line the pockets of the elite?
