Never thought they wanted Kiev or much beyond Donbas. But I don't trust Russia anymore than I do Ukraine. Every war they fight is a mess at outset. Sometimes they get it together, others not."

All the area &amp; drone bombing is foolish if they have to retreat behind the river.
For months, #Ukraine hinted on the offensive nothing was planned on 🇷🇺 side, only to withdraw on day 1.
#Crimea @ risk now."

Russia has a massive naval base there, and significant industrial interests.

For Ukraine to retake Crimea, it will have to invade. If you think that is a smart idea, that's where we will part ways."
