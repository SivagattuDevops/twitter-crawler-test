1589675450749444096,Mon Nov 07 17:45:36 +0000 2022,@CleanFutureFund You're believing in your own lies. The only state which act as a terrorist state is Ukraine. Deliberately killing their own people. Suppressing them and letting them feel being second rated citizens. It started in 2014 and not in 2022. But what do you know. You're clueless.
