The problem is just as much that the police aren't interested in doing it than it is the DAs not prosecuting. NYC has a police budget greater than Ukraine's defense budge, DAs unafraid of booking murders and a clearance rate below 50%"

1589087410977054720,Sun Nov 06 02:48:57 +0000 2022,@ResistRun Israel hasn't supported Ukraine so I would read this as a desperate call for assistance including with the Russians to whom the Israelis have deep connections. But Ukraine will probably converge with the Eastern Block and Israel into neoliberal ethnonationalism we have to oppose.

You need to be held ACCOUNTABLE for stealing $70Billion from the working &amp; middle class and laundering it through Ukraine. The only apology you can give is to your son for being a s#!t example of a man. GTFOH
