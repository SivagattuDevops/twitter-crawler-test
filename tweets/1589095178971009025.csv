1589094488248459264,Sun Nov 06 03:17:04 +0000 2022,.@McFaul .@SecBlinken My fear if Republicans win is they will abandon Ukraine &amp; Putin will be emboldened to expand the war across Europe. Eventually this will lead to a wider war. The world had a united America devoted to democracy in 1941. They will not have that in 2023.
