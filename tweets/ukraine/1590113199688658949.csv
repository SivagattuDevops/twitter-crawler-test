I didn’t vote for laws that solely benefit governments and corporations

I didn’t vote to kill innocent people in forever wars funded by banks that profit from ALL sides of the war

I didn’t vote for any of that. 
Not. A. Democracy."

There are many Jews in Russia itself, who could be at risk if Israel were to help Ukraine."
1590112764554420224,Tue Nov 08 22:43:20 +0000 2022,An excellent win here as Ukraine took out an s300 air defense missile battery. Has a range of 40km and Russia has been using them to target urban areas. It's a loss of 3M USD for Putin. #StandWithUkraine https://t.co/WwKtriAaC6 https://t.co/duS04WJbbc

We know their soldiers are already ill-equipped and lucky to eat every three days. I have serious doubts that they will make it through the winter, and that’s not even considering the losses Ukraine forces will inflict upon them."

To me, Democracy &amp; reproductive freedom mean much more than the stock market. American women &amp; girls deserve Freedom.
