Ukr is effectively a puppet of NATO supplying the cannon fodder."

More than 70000 humans sent to slaughter. More than 70000 bereaved families. 
For what ?! For defending fascism ?!
It's criminal in itself."

It's a lame argument and it no longer works. You are welcome to suit up and head to Ukraine, but it's not your sons and daughters who will die. I've been to war, I know what it means."
