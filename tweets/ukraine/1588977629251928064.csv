They call it a quid pro quo. They impeached trump for it despite no evidence it ever occurred but biden is on video bragging about it.

The article was written in 2014 and describes the events of 2012-2013 - the year or two before the Maidan,when Ukraine still had the pro-Russian president. Try harder next time, I guess. https://t.co/81smcliJae"

except Ukraine will never get close to this shore and this question is hypothetical lol"
