And future Ukraine neutrality is also a must, for it was the main reason for the war, after all."

This country is in dire straits thanks to Democratic policies.  Biden is the reason Russia went into Ukraine in the first place. He talked NATO and his awful Afghanistan response showed weakness to all. China is next.
