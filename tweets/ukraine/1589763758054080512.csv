1589763272424951809,Mon Nov 07 23:34:35 +0000 2022,@kbar57 @JoeBiden Do you know that Ukraine is at war with Russia?  Do you know that Putin has left 80% of the country without water and without electricity?  On what basis do you say that Ukraine is getting rich?  The EU also help you.  Do you want your grandchildren to speak Russian or Chinese.??

Of course Iran's drones have turned the tide of this war in favor of Russia. No amount of air defence can help Ukraine against Iran's most primitive and oldest kamikaze drone. Accept reality instead of calling your enemy a Nazi ! https://t.co/8hdS0jdOP9
