He has once again gotten in front of the Biden Administration &amp; inadvertently serviced the Putin agenda by adding pressure for Ukraine to deliver concessions.

1591129020896247809,Fri Nov 11 18:01:34 +0000 2022,@BeauTFC in one of your recent videos you speculated that the lack of a Republican wave might affect how Russia handles losing the war in Ukraine. I know correlation isn't causation but is there a link between this and their apparent retreat from Kherson?

Seems to have been in Ukraine since about 2018, fighting/shelling DPR/LPR.

Obviously he fights with Right Sector Bde. Grieves his losses about the fallen mercs, this clown is embedded with the Spanish clowsns.
