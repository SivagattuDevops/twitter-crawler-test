Thay meant politics mattered more. Singapore and South Korea have a lot more to lose. Even Taiwan. Will they put up with the closure of the Malacca Straits?

This job should really fall onto the entire West. USA/West allowed this to happen when in 1945 they didn't push USSR back to Russia's borders before 🇷🇺 cloned 🇺🇸's nuclear weapons.
