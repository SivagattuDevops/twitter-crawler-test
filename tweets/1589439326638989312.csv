1589438839281831936,Mon Nov 07 02:05:24 +0000 2022,USA ($25b) &amp; UK ($4b) are the highest supporters of the Ukraine war effort. In relative terms these sums amount to approx 0.1% of either country's GDP. Perhaps not as much as we might think but high time a deal was brokered. Contentious to ask but would Trump have acted sooner? https://t.co/jCSP2rESjH
