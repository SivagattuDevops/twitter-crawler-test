1590763833320411136,Thu Nov 10 17:50:27 +0000 2022,@Kilfalwol The Ukraine war  is like most modern wars. Neither side can win. A compromise deal is always done in every war. It’s better to end this war this year in an unsatisfactory peace deal now rather than wait another 5 years with more unnecessary deaths.

Few good land crossings for starters both across the Dniper and then closer to Crimea. Air Superiority would be paramount to complete that. Very, very tough work from here for Ukraine"
