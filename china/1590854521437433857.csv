The foundations, plumbing, sewerage, electricity supply etc etc. There's no way these are just being built to up China's GDP or unemployment rate."

1590853784829235202,Thu Nov 10 23:47:53 +0000 2022,@POTUS Well a lot of places had to shut down due to your friends in China who created the virus. So it makes sense why the unemployment was down. You had the easy part.  You just had to reopen everything and unemployment went down. It’s not like you created any jobs for anyone. 🤦🏽‍♂️

If doing business with the Chinese is criminal, then you better look at the guy who had his signature red hats and  campaign banners made in China, had a Chinese bank account while President, and asked the Chinese president to help him get re-elected. Insider Trading? Funny."
1590853755440091136,Thu Nov 10 23:47:46 +0000 2022,@zoddwalker I work with plenty of immigrants from china and they are not expected to speak keigo. When I worked in Australia I didn't expect my coworkers from India to have perfect English. Most people will never be native level in another language and I think people understand that.
