1590166401767333888,Wed Nov 09 02:16:28 +0000 2022,@staugrecord Biden and Ukraine? F that. Nuclear war was on the ballot. They ruin my chili's dinner with the TV show Jan 6 or Ukraine crap. Sick of it.
1590166399426924544,Wed Nov 09 02:16:28 +0000 2022,@SenWarren You mean how Biden gave Ukraine well over 1 billion taxpayer dollars.
1590166396222464001,Wed Nov 09 02:16:27 +0000 2022,"@bzoffka Totally. Yes the stimulus had inflationary effects but the proximate cause was the Ukraine invasion and the remote cause was the speculative bubble across all asset classes during the Trump presidency: real estate, crypto, equities and securities. Correction + recession"
1590166388936953856,Wed Nov 09 02:16:25 +0000 2022,"@UnitedGOPParty @ABlackPolitical You most certainly don‚Äôt know that. Information coming in from Russia suggests that Putin is pushing this takeover asap, and is also upset at the slow speed of things, because he had underlying health issues  and wanted to take back Ukraine before he croaked."

1590166357496061952,Wed Nov 09 02:16:18 +0000 2022,@RepSwalwell @CoreResponse This brought tears to my eyes.  Perhaps it's because tonight we are seeing how many are willing to support fascism while in Ukraine they're  fighting to the death to prevent it from stealing their democracy.

Even better..you love Ukraine so much why not head there, pick up a gun and stand a post. Would be more impactful than having that virtue signling flag on you Twitter account."

Biden has brought us to the brink of nuclear war for the first time since the 60s!  You are the crazy one!  If Trump was in office no Ukraine war!  We need more sanity, like under Trump."
