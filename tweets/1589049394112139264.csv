1589048678601613315,Sun Nov 06 00:15:02 +0000 2022,@MatthewPinas @mtaibbi Technology was a deflationary factor that has largely ran its course ‚Äúfor now‚Äù and China?

I ought to say I don't get living life this pessimistic about the GOP while being a conservative. It's similar to believing that the US is set to be overtaken by China as one of the more delusional NatCons. Cheer up.
