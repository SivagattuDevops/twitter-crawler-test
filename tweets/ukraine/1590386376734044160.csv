They are getting a million winter uniforms from Canada, the US, Norway, Sweden, and Finland.  Frozen Russian soldiers do not make good defenders.  Stopping them from building heated shelters is good strategy."

Still fearing could play some dirty tricks as soon as Ukrainian troops enter the town (destroying the dam and flooding  vast areas and Kherson or a nuclear weapon). But if not so: Brave Ukraine!

Ukraine could shift its focus more to Lugansk and Zaporizhya. But there are still doubts about Russian discipline, reserves and logistics. https://t.co/hp1r56DjX2"
