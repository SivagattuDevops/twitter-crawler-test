Russia's future is at stake and NATO keeps pushing them further into a corner and Ukraine is the last straw furthering encroachment while threatening their oil economy.
1591185842462392320,Fri Nov 11 21:47:22 +0000 2022,Russia can also displace Ukrainian citizens from those regions through a variety of repressive or permissive measures. It can make their life hell in various ways and allow them to depart for unoccupied parts of Ukraine. Probably many would give up a lot to escape from Putin. 6/

Trump did arm Ukraine after Obama allowed Crimea/ Donbas taken. Trump put two new NATO bases at Putin‚Äôs door step, wiped out Wagner brigade in Syria. Let‚Äôs be fair and honest."

I hope, that our government come to sin and there will be enough APCs and MBTs for ukraine to recapture what's yours."

The cost is a small % of our single yr budget. I can think of nothing that is a better bargain. UKR is following aggressive NATO acctg rules &amp; US is now auditing. https://t.co/aih73lH5LY
