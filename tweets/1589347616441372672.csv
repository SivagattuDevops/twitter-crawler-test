1589347244628914176,Sun Nov 06 20:01:26 +0000 2022,"@peterpalmer901 @TimothyDSnyder Agreed. The enemy here is not just the Russian incursion -- it's superpower adventurism. No superpower should be allowed to invade its neighbors just because they are a superpower and they want to. By supporting Ukraine saying 'NYET' to Russia, we are also protecting Taiwan."

He rattles his nuclear weapons and attacks Latvia who invokes Article 5? Then what? Now it's a world war, congratulation isolationism."

1589347198739046400,Sun Nov 06 20:01:15 +0000 2022,@Daily_Express It's a self inflicted harm! You guys are supporting your governments in their proxy war in Ukraine! Now enjoy your misery in full!!
