Some are too elderly to leave on own .

The basic issue is faces is that much of its advanced weaponry (HIMARS, HARM, NASMS, etc) is not produced domestically but is being provided to it by NATO countries. So its overriding priority is to maintain political support for these supplies."

This is the reality and this doesn't mean 90% are Russian, it just means they're fed up with lies of MSM, Ukr Nazism, the visceral hatred of US towards Russia and the poverty that results from this.
