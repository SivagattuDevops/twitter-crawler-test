1590643132185874432,Thu Nov 10 09:50:50 +0000 2022,@RobPalmerIRL Right. I think Putin knows going to war with NATO would be the end of him and his military quickly. I wonder how our support for Ukraine will change if the GOP takes the House. I'm hopeful that we'll figure it out. There's enough support from their side to keep sending weapons.
