1589289251413245953,Sun Nov 06 16:10:59 +0000 2022,@TimothyDSnyder Thank you for explanation to those who doubt give or not give support to Ukraine. Appeseament never works with dictators. It is so obvious but some prefer wear pink eyeglasses and miss the truth.

1589289233272799237,Sun Nov 06 16:10:55 +0000 2022,"Given Putin’s brutal war in Ukraine, growing criticism of him at home and reliance on rogue states abroad, the international community shouldn’t be bolstering his standing. Putin’s invite to the G20 summit in Indonesia this month is extant. Western govts should get it rescinded."

And Putin will fight to the last Russian - almost without resistance of the last ones from being sent to slaughter."

Lord knows everyone's heard the chatter by now that Ukraine is a deathbed for these tourists with guns. Common sense combined with undeniable facts have kicked in for the average Russian.

Ukraine is taking Russia off the chessboard and boxing China’s in. If that cost $1T, it would be cheap."
