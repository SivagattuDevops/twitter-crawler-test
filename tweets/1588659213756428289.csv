Have you visited Russia away from Moscow &amp; St P‚Äôsberg. I did in 2016. People looked both ways before cautiously telling me (i hadn‚Äôt asked) how they hated Putin. They don‚Äôt want to invade Ukraine. They want basic infrastructure &amp; services.

1588658857697775616,Fri Nov 04 22:26:02 +0000 2022,Prices are raised because supply is low.  Biden shut down the XL pipeline because he's against American oil.  This is the whole reason the economy has tanked and Russia attacked Ukraine. When Trump was president Russia didn't attack anyone or take over any territory. @bebebovay https://t.co/XtezH2ZtHb
