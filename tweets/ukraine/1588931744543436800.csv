1588931513135280131,Sat Nov 05 16:29:28 +0000 2022,"@ExPat24712 @lesiavasylenko Thank you for the clarification. You are correct; it is 90%. However, the war hasn’t been going on for a year yet. So the comparison to the annual budget is legit in my opinion. I support Ukraine entirely, but to say the US has given half-assed aid is incorrect in my view."

And when Russian soldiers are leaving mass graves in towns they occupy of people they tortured, that sounds like genocide.

But good luck with your genocide denialism."
