1590402311364702209,Wed Nov 09 17:53:53 +0000 2022,@senrobportman So are you going to take another tax payer funded trip to tell Ukraine you sold them out and Vance won't support them.
1590402309988589568,Wed Nov 09 17:53:53 +0000 2022,These are Hazara children.  They are being targeted by those who do not believe they have the right to live!  We must pressure Congress to get involved.  We all see what‚Äôs going on in Ukraine but the genocide of the Hazara people is being kept in the dark.  #StopHazaraGenocide

1590402294113533953,Wed Nov 09 17:53:49 +0000 2022,@Penguz4 @GeromanAT Russia is in no hurry to take any new terretory. Sacrificing terretory to shorten the frontline and cencentrate more defenses will make Ukrainian advances all the harder. The west is also reaching its limit at what it can provide to Ukraine.

I don't care if a Russian company could provide the same services as a more Belgian one. The Russian economy must not profit."

It will free up forces for both sides. I dont imagine Ukraine trying to cross the river any time soon."
