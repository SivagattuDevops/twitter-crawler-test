1591045967260049408,Fri Nov 11 12:31:33 +0000 2022,@Arnold_Platon @DrRadchenko The trouble is that the February 24th defensive line in the Donbas is very strong (has been built for 8 years) and getting around it would require an incursion deep into the territory of Russia. I don't know if Ukraine has a green light from the US for that kind of operation.
