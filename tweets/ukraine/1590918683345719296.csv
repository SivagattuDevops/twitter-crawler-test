If that happens, then Europe has an even bigger catastrophe coming for it that further threatens the existence of the EU.

The difference is the US has a real economy, and can afford to lose a war, unlike Russia. Losing in Afghanistan destroyed the USSR, just as losing in Ukraine will destroy the much smaller Russia. Good luck with that."
