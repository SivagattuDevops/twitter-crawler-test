Is it bizarre that Ukraine would want to join a defensive alliance given its suffering at the hands of Russia/USSR? Yet you think the side carrying out the invasion to reclaim 'little russia' is the anti-imperalist.

For the media to be portraying the Ukraine to be winning if  they're losing, near collapse, would prove disastrous when eventually they would lose.

The lie can only ever digress so and so far from reality."
