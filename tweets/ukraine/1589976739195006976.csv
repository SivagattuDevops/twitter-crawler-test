1589976339968561152,Tue Nov 08 13:41:14 +0000 2022,@Bearofthenorth2 @BirdsofParadiz8 @AP Biden just recently told Zelensky to be more open to peace talks. I have no idea why other than Biden is seeing this as an anchor around his neck. He can't just drop support because his base won't like that but he doesn't want to go into the 2024 election still supporting Ukraine
