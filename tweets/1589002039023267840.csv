Nobody made him commit thousands of war crimes against Ukrainian civilians or to attempt to overthrow the Ukrainian government. The tradition of Russia trying to dominate the country

Either way attacking Belarusian territory will end badly for Ukraine. Russia knows that, Ukraine probably knows that too. So, the risk of an attack on those military vehicles is minimal to none"

And yet, neither Ukraine nor their European allies want this. They prefer the Russian soldiers to kill and die."
