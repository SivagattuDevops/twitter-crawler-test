An attack on Gotland, on the other hand, could have been a way for Putler to vent his megalomania."
1589298404730945537,Sun Nov 06 16:47:22 +0000 2022,@SamRamani2 Nothing wrong with replenishing military armour and equipment. Ukraine gets military support from across the globe.
1589298392853012481,Sun Nov 06 16:47:19 +0000 2022,"Sorry? How does this work?

Russia invades Ukraine, rapes women &amp; kids, displaces &amp; kills 1,000’s, maims 1,000’s more, destroys infrastructure &amp; homes, but US officials expect Zelensky to acquiesce?

Why aren’t they warning Putin? https://t.co/T6fNrbYkOW"

Perhaps it’s not a good idea for US which gets shitloads of money (continuing a situation where the only fuel is their own LNG at any price they like) but it’s not for EU
Ukraine would have lost without tech support. 
So, they better find a mid ground solution &amp; let EU be ffs"

Ukraine has every right, legally and morally, to defend and liberate all of their territory and all of their people.

Everything else is smoke and mirrors.
