He‚Äôs one of the few that care about the national debt and he tried to get some accountability for the endless stream of Ukraine money. Not to mention his pushback against COVID tyrants.

But so is a negotiated settlement. Korean War stalemated for 2 years before a ceasefire was reached. Iran-Iraq War stalemated for 6 years. https://t.co/Oys9bBoe1P"

The only off-road for this is for Russia to completely withdraw from all Ukrainian lands. Then Putin and his associates must surrender themselves for crimes against humanity. Then Ukraine must be immediately entered into NATO!

Russia manufactured civil war there by arming terrorists to try and take control on their behalf. These are the people Ukraine have been fighting.
