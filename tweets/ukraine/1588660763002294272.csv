1588660416179482624,Fri Nov 04 22:32:13 +0000 2022,@ukraine_map Unfortunately the Abrams is not suitable for the Ukrainian terrain. The T72 weighs in at 41.5 tons while the Abrams is a whopping 20 tons heavier at 62 tons!  An Abrams will have a very difficult time coping with the soft and wet terrain.
