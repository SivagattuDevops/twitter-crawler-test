Support for Ukraine amongst the public has decreased dramatically so the democrats are just playing the game. Militarily everything they are doing is ever escalating the situation.

1) Do nothing, like we did when they grabbed Crimea or..
2) Do the right thing and help our allies defend their country like we told them we we do and help protect Europe as well.

But ur not really interested in that."
