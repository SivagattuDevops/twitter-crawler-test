1589104156337283073,Sun Nov 06 03:55:29 +0000 2022,Republicans are so stupid they don’t want to fund the war in Ukraine. They’d rather let the Russians attack us here at home and then spend any amount of money to defend our homes. The point of NATO and it’s helping Ukraine is to keep wars in Europe not here in the United States. https://t.co/3B4PlcJSkT

BLM protests? Our government uses violence regularly.  We don't overthrow the democratically elected leader because of it.  And the Russian deal was better for Ukraine than the EU was.
