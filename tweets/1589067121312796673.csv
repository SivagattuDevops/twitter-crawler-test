Ukraine would really have it easier if it’s territory was more homogenous. In 1989 for example, Poland was offered western Ukraine back (by Gorbachev) but refused. The value of being homogeneous state is too important."

Forgot to mention that Twitter, as a communication platform, is also a veritable lifeline to - and with - vulnerable communities such as Ukraine.  Do you REALLY want to mess with a simple, elegant means of communication for $8.00 per post/account?????"

We've been busy printing money out of thin air for Covid, Ukraine and many other things.

Just get some rain barrels or something.

You need to learn to be more sympathetic to the federal government and their priorities."
