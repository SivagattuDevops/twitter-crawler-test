Today war is just pure nonsense even from Ukro point of view. Putin would give up Cherson for armistice. The rest is just beyond ukros capability.

I'm from Ukraine. By telling, us that we need to negotiate now you support, that we should just agree, that our people are under occupation. This is russian narrative. Also, russia will use this peace for a second attempt, where they can succeed. Like it was with Ichkeria."
