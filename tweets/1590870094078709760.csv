1590869631618940928,Fri Nov 11 00:50:51 +0000 2022,@KamperGeek Okay. It's now up to Russia and Ukraine to decide. NATO has done nothing but expand since the day they promised not to after the fall of the Soviet Union. They're a military bureaucracy. Of course they'd want more control.

Pretty much gave Putin a green light. Politicians always incite war. This is done for the military arms complex who pays them off and donates so much money to their campaigns. Both parties!
