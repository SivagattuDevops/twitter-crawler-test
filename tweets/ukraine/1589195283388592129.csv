COVID, Ukraine, … are tools to building the bridge from a capitalist growth mindset to a circular de-growth world. “You own nothing and you’ll be happy”."

Are you happy that we tried to put NATO and Nukes in Russias backyard after we promised we wouldn’t. This is their Cuban middle crisis. We knew this would happen. Do bass was getting shelled by Ukraine for yrs. All areas occupied voted 90-95% to stay Russian.
