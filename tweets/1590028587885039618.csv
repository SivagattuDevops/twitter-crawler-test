Good you pointed out Ukraine. See how much military assistance it has received from the West. Putin's war has backfired. He thought he would win in a few days. Here we are now."

It's almost like the State Department told them to prepare for a Republican Congress."

Many of them tell them how much better Ukrainians live (compared to how the Russians have it). Maybe that's why there's so much looting of common items."
1590028249815404544,Tue Nov 08 17:07:30 +0000 2022,@Antifa_Stripper Yeah I’m not standing on moral high ground on this but I do think Ukraine needs to tighten up their ROE before this ends and the world gets a deep look at everything that happened. Russia is absolutely not innocent but war crimes are war crimes.
1590028235319885824,Tue Nov 08 17:07:27 +0000 2022,@SmoothFellaRuss Gas fields found off Crimea was why they invaded that. Ditto Ukraine. Which when you look at the map also explains why they gave up on Kyiv. Other than taking a beating of course. https://t.co/d2cgDbM5hE

That's why the 1st Guards Tank Army fled in panic from Izium. Why do you think Strelkov and Rybar were calling for Shoigu to be fired?

Or are they not sending their best?"
