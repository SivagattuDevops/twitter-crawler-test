Are they a part of the Russian military? Am I paying for their war? Will you answer literally anything I've said or will you just cry about Nazis who I'm not giving my tax money to vs. the ones whose war I'm paying for?

You don't know war. You don't know what's at stake. You are quick to judge without understanding."
