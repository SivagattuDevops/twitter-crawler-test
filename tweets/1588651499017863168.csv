1588650900578766848,Fri Nov 04 21:54:25 +0000 2022,@andygrace @the_mendii @elonmusk It's a poor business decision. That is a massive market that will be serviced by competitors. Why do you think China is so interested in investing in African and South American markets? Do you think Beijing doesn't like wealth and influence?
1588650896745172993,Fri Nov 04 21:54:24 +0000 2022,@vonderburchard The West never learns. Foolish positioning for early and short gratification like this ends with undesirable counter weight like the once impossible military alliance between Russia and China. Its better not to push buttons without REAL need to satisfy politics

Russia is not going to help anyone and same as China,they will use us to grow their economy.  More reason Nigeria and Africa must solve its problems away from them all."
1588650884719853574,Fri Nov 04 21:54:21 +0000 2022,"@simoj_ @DanielleFong @mattparlmer @LevPo @MorlockP Yeah, $40 Trillion is a rough guess at the total money spent building Factory China.

And partly because they can no longer keep the lights on and partly because rolling Zero-COVID lockdowns (or 40MM dead, not a joke), and partly because 10x natgas prices, it's all worthless now."

1588650800477540352,Fri Nov 04 21:54:01 +0000 2022,@FreshKarlRenner My layman-y opinion hasn't changed for a log time: be honest. Germany's favorite populist FP is full of lies (Zeitwende &amp; other empty speeches; Russia; China; etc). This makes it impossible for others to have any kind of debate about it with Germany. Because on words it's all OK.
