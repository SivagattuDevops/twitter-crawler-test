1590844196533207040,Thu Nov 10 23:09:47 +0000 2022,@Bankiboom @DGisSERIOUS Snark perfectly warranted. Nowhere in FP article does author mention Chamberlain negotiating w/Hitler &amp; waving a piece of peace paper that Hitler never honored.  That's precisely what peace processors want Ukraine to do w/Russia.  This war has elements of both WWI &amp; WWII

Does the USA own Ukraine yet?
Perhaps it's time to send equal $$$ and weapons to US border.
If any country's borders are this important, it should be our own.  POTUS attention to Ukraine insane while USA is being lost https://t.co/jlHZ4t3Foe"
