It's a straw man argument if you are ignoring both sides. Equally china isn't green in manufacturing. Many of it's major mnf cities are straight out victorian England with smog.

So we will have #British  people freezing to death to change 1% of global emissions while we buy foreign gas and stuff from #China  etc made from power produced from coal. Business goes bust, jobs lost. As Germany ups coal power.

 Madness."

It may have originated in the country, but calling it the ""CCP Virus"" is an unfounded assertion."

In any case you cannot punish a country for something that wasn‚Äôt recognised as a issue until the 1940s at the earliest but in reality the 1980s."

1589668751641047040,Mon Nov 07 17:18:59 +0000 2022,@f_j_j_ LMAO at the Yuan being the reserve currency!! There are more Yuan printed that can only be used in China every year than the US prints dollars. If the dollar collapses the Yuan disappears completely. It has literally no value outside of China without the dollar.
