1589971278748082177,Tue Nov 08 13:21:07 +0000 2022,This is another indication of the losses being incurred by the Ukraine government.  This is a sure fire way for Zelenskyy to lose the support of moneyed interests in Ukraine.  Anyone thinking Ukraine is winning or can win conflict it's having with Russia is deluding themselves.

I know eclipses happen often, but when they line up with a significant date you shouldn’t shrug them off. In 2014 Francis released 2 doves for peace in Ukraine. They were devoured by scavenger birds. That was a portend too"
1589971264449699842,Tue Nov 08 13:21:04 +0000 2022,Ukraine accused Russia of looting empty homes in the southern city of Kherson and occupying them with troops in civilian clothes to prepare for street fighting in what both sides predict will be one of the war’s most important battles. https://t.co/34yocREmjr
