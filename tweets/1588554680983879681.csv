That's fear mongering from the same people claiming Russia is going to take over the world after it's done with Ukraine. The US ran itself broke in debt nation building and Russia has much lower GDP. You have an irrational fear.

They spent weeks criticizing him for not doing 'enough.' They spent weeks criticizing him for doing 'too much.' 

They never congratulate him for getting it exactly right.
