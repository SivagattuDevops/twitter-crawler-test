1589858178841612288,Tue Nov 08 05:51:42 +0000 2022,@pati_marins64 @LeftyCosta That‚Äôs not true. Ukraine had less than 100 Buks and 300 S-300 launchers at the start of the war. Only 12% or 35 S-300s were confirmed destroyed. 21 S-300s were destroyed in the first months of the war. Russia used +750 Iskanders but rarely hit big cities as they‚Äôre hit by S-300s.

We never lost a war.

1) USSR was not #Russia, it was many countries including #Ukraine that you love so much
2) #Afghanistan was not a war. Only a special support operation to the legitimate government. We just sent peacekeepers there unlike #USA https://t.co/imAG3rv8Wp"
