Here's something I've noticed watching a violent revolution and a war, guns help in securing freedom for the people."

The aid for Ukraine is serving the interests of 40 million people not being overrun by murderous vatniks who've been convinced they're all Nazis/Satanists/genocide instigators. 1/2"

1590035426756415488,Tue Nov 08 17:36:01 +0000 2022,@graysongraham @Jonatha04031958 @sickofthecity1 @castletongreene So the US has just issued a backchannel request for Ukraine to soften and negotiate with Russia. It seems there's not that much support internationally for a war of annihilation in Ukraine - that'll worsen with winter - and significantly threaten world food and energy supplies.
