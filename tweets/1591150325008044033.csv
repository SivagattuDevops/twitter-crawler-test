People being aware that there is going to be a vote is not the same as them being able to vote. They are all going to have to either return and be verified as eligible to vote OR they are going to have to be traced and sent ballots.

The idea that these people wanted Russia there is silly. I won’t be unmuting though because I’m sure you’ll call it fake or something. Sorry not in the mood for foolishness. https://t.co/3Zc8wspG2Y

But despite early set backs, Ukrainians shows that they are fierce fighters. #SlavaUkrainii"

If Trump were in office she'd be home already!  That's what you get for being a American hating Democrat!  She can serve her full term in Russia - and probably will!
