1589305569919504384,Sun Nov 06 17:15:50 +0000 2022,@CBSNews What is the reason for the problems? Is it because Russia was not able to clean up their country. After the destruction of the power plant. And now Ukraine is at their limit in providing for Russia. I am not really sure what the problem really is.
