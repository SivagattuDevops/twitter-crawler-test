2. Open the damn pipeline like trump did for energy independence.

They are a long way away from NATO, but they sure are showing they are falling directly in line with the military standards.

Russia is showing the old way, throw bodies at the problem, central control, no modular structure."

This entire issue is bc Putin wants EVERY INCH of territory the USSR previously held. Ukraine broke away in the 90s.
