Could you help me?
I with my wife Sabina relocated in England but our child Davyd stayed in Ukraine. We applied 
for the program Homes for Ukraine on our child, and we can't get an answer for a long time. I hope very much for your help.
Best regards.

To say it again: the return of #Crimea to #Ukraine isn't negotiable.
Shame on those who suggest it could be the subject of a compromise under false &amp; unworthy pretexts (red line for Moscow, ""risk of escalation""...).
The West must also aim to liberate Crimea. https://t.co/WfdoVWZpOR"

Maybe when you run a business &amp; actually hire ppl &amp; fund payroll (how most of the country lives on) you may be worthy to bash Mr. Musk.
