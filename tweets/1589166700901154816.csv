1589166189858942977,Sun Nov 06 08:01:59 +0000 2022,@FYI234 @matthewstoller Yes thank you. I don't think there's been much organized pushback against this scarcity narrative yet because most of the people politically inclined to do so don't deeply understand supply chains. But the marginal gun still has more impact in Ukraine.

52 countries,including Germany,Italy and Austria,voted at the UN AGAINST the annual Russian resolution on combating the glorification of Nazism.A year ago there were only two of them-USA and Ukraine.

You NAZI! https://t.co/zCKMB8wjGU"

Let's not forget the billions of weapons he's sent to Ukraine that the US can't even account 10%of. There are now actual US men and Women in Ukraine https://t.co/nKYaWo0hT8"
1589166161023074306,Sun Nov 06 08:01:52 +0000 2022,@DavidEkelof @pawelwargan Stupid. Resolution was introduced in 2005. No country other than Ukraine or the U.S. had any issue voting for it until this year. Clearly unrelated to the invasion. All it does is prove Russia’s point that the West condones Nazism once it’s in their interests to do so.

So it's only because of Russia that Ukraine borders Hungary, and via Hungarian-speaking turf."
