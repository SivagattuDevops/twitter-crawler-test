Instead of shipping surplus weapons to Ukraine, now we‚Äôre committing American soldiers. Get it?"

That's why greater complementarity between the US, NATO, and the EU is the only way forward.

One can't sustain troop loosing ratio 6.5:1 against Ukraine in country which can't mobilize even 300k (they said they did it but actually it's around 240k of whom big part can't be equipped to be sent to front). Money income won't solve that problem.
