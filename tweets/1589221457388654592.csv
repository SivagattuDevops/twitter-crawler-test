- They blow up the dam and flood the city. Say bye bye to the entire South because Zapo NPP will go Chernobyl 2: Tsar Bomba Edition

- NATO intervenes directly. I don't have to tell you what that precipitates"

Ukraine, and Europe as a whole, is next in line.

Hindsight is a b*tch! However, Russia was JUST kicked out of NATO in Oct of 2021, so it probably took a minute for it to sink in to the rest of NATO wtf was actually going on. Sell???"

I even have some respect for them as they are honest in their belief. But people like you? Just scum. Ukronazis don’t need your support. You betray them 🤡🤡"

Is that why the US and Ukraine voted against that anti-Nazi UN resolution?

Is that why the US congress has removed the ban on funding and arming Neo-Nazi gangs?

Is that why the US has been propping up Nazi sympathizers in Ukraine for decades? https://t.co/JxVyeqtfxb"

Breaches like this one makes it harder to keep up military support for ukraine. People who accept such actions and even share and glorify videos about it can be deemd to be enemies of ukraine imo.
