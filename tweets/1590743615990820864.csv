1590743270065598465,Thu Nov 10 16:28:44 +0000 2022,Dzhankoi so far is the main hub and is central to moving further into Southern Ukraine. Rail and air are options here. Russia would have to lean more on rail than road due to the explosions. Road route from Rostov(E58/M14) past Taganrog- Mariupol-Melitopol is also possible
1590743267536429056,Thu Nov 10 16:28:44 +0000 2022,Attempts to hold Ukraine at bay will rely on ranged weaponry from Russia also. No doubt the Kerch bridge explosion caused some logistical issues for Russia and with that not likely to be repaired until mid-late 2023 fully some problems ahead.
1590743264352620553,Thu Nov 10 16:28:43 +0000 2022,Russia may dig in and will likely face ranged attacks from Ukrainian forces. Ukraine still has the same issue Russia faced which is there is a river in the way. Ru attacks are most likely going to be aimed at infrastructure in Winter.

You see the suffering of the people in Ukraine over and beyond the suffering in other areas under occupation and perpetual war.

You're more than entitled to have that world view"

What policy did you think was great and helped the economy?  Russia got private meetings with Trump and got Trump to provide conditions to Ukraine about not using Javelin missiles on Russia.  Most of Trump's business is in China.
