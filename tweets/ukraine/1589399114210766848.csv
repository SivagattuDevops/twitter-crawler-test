It is segments within the Republican Party. Those segments should be noted not the entire party. I would say the same if it were Democrats."

We are talking about the US involvement in changing regimes. The Ukraine here is not the point. What the Russians are doing in Syria is even worse than what they are doing the Ukraine under the watchful eyes of the US but no one seems to care.
