Zelensky has appointed Nazis to his government and Nazism is rampant in Ukraine's military. https://t.co/kl28q11xOI"

West always wanted to dismember Russia. Partition/puppet govt means subjugation of all Russia's peoples &amp; plunder of her resources as the West has done across the globe.

This conflict ends w/ Russian victory, or fire &amp; death for all. https://t.co/1nYlvc5Rf4"
