They worship MONEY while the other side (DemonCRats) worships the DEVIL.

1588886007956791302,Sat Nov 05 13:28:39 +0000 2022,"@nexta_tv If Ukraine falls, rest of European continental area at risk.

If largest industrialised nations &amp; major allies of USA fall, USA isolated. USA's losses would be rivals gain.

Then USA may face almost whole World. Alone.

That wouldn't be good. IMO of course."

I'd like to give back, after all I keep taking and sending to Ukraine to be laundered for my homeboys and girls.' https://t.co/hryFejf0EG"

Lol looks like the lefts weak posture and communist ideologies and not knowing what bathroom to use paved the way for our current position as well as Ukraine’s
1588885975107006465,Sat Nov 05 13:28:31 +0000 2022,"@NoOphend @VALERIEinNYT @nytimes @vsaffron This legit makes no sense what so ever. I didn’t see Russia invade Ukraine while a GOP president was in office. So who does Russia get the most support from? Also, Russian culture politics have nothing to do with support from either party in the US and vise versa."

When will it be enough?
When will you people see how wrong you are?"
