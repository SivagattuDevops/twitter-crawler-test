1590712067803484160,Thu Nov 10 14:24:45 +0000 2022,@nexta_tv Glory to the heroes. Incredible bravery and perseverance.  I am so humbled that Ukraine will recapture Kherson.  This means Crimea will be liberated next. Every vatnik barbarian needs to either surrender to UA or go back to the paradise of the Russian Federation.
