Because otherwise they will just invade, loot, rape, pillage and torture elsewhere. Besides, Russia is already planning its next wave of missile/drone terror attacks against Ukrainian civilians."

2) With only a slim majority in the House, the GOP will focus on a brosadly popular agenda, and the general public supports Ukraine."

Because we built it

But like I said before the federal government sanctioned slavery so they are on the hook for it.

I had nothing to do with what's going on in Ukraine but because my government is supporting it it comes out of my taxes

Right?"
