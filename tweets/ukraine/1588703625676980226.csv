Ukraine should give Russia the (economically worthless) Crimea. Ukrainians have proven their metal (without NATO). They cannot/will not be defeated. The deed is done.

That would be a bad shift of power and genocide to Ukraine people. It's not about stopping some Nazis in Ukraine, it's just about killing all civilians who don't want to be part of Russia.
