1588194310255792129,Thu Nov 03 15:40:05 +0000 2022,"@neil_abrams @aaronjmate Peace is a step by step process 

Imagine a small scale western shootout 

Step 1. First they agree to stop shooting

One guy agrees to drop his gun on one side, one guy on the other side does the same, and so on until everyone is disarmed 

Ukraine never stopped shooting"

Ukraine doesn’t do that. They will prefer to use civilians as means to get more money from the West. Classic example of the Bucha case. Why is Ukraine still refusing to the UN in to investigate the crime
1588194297194729477,Thu Nov 03 15:40:02 +0000 2022,"@damienmullan85 @Big_Frank88LFC Yes, there are two Putin conspiracies:
1. That there is such a holiday. That is fake news, as I showed separately.
2. That this means modern Ukraine is some Nazi state, rather than what it is: A flawed democracy being invaded and raped by a Nazi state, Russia."
1588194294971748355,Thu Nov 03 15:40:01 +0000 2022,"Oh no!

After checking three Ukrainian facilities, the IAEA mission has not found any evidence that Ukraine is preparing a dirty bomb.

The UN Security Council also rejected Russia's initiative to investigate the alleged American bio labs where they prepare the mosquitoes.

US weapons in Russia's hands and no US support for Europe. Think on that. https://t.co/hDojNr6bxC"

Trump also attempted to use Ukraine to manipulate the election in 2020. Trump refused help to Ukraine and was attempting to withdraw from NATO, leaving the EU open to Putin. Trump alienated allies."

You are referring to the US, UK, and France, right?

BTW, Ukraine hasn't been a peaceful country, but has been at war since 2014, when the US and EU overthrew its government and the post-coup regime started attacking Donbass."

If you think that I am wrong, look at the facts and think!"

Trump is Putin's general in the USA, and the GOP politicians are Trump's officers in his army. MAGA are the soldiers."
