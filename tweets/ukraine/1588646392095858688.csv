If Russia has its way and forms an alliance with the BRICS nations or, God forbid, replace the $ as WRC, America perishes overnight."

It prolongs the war and makes MASSIVE massive profits for US weapons manufacturers and stockholders which include many members of Congress. Expect the bills to keep passing

Putin condemned this as a “deliberately perverted attitude to the history of Ukraine&amp;Russia”."
