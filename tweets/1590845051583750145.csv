That‚Äôs people responded to Ukraine praising a literal Nazi who worked with Hitler. 

At this point newly created üá∫üá¶ accounts this year are Slava Bandera &amp; Slava Ukrainian Nazis. They just hate when others point it out."

Hei, meta. Why are you blocking me on Facebook for this? Are you in favour of the war in Ukraine and supporting the Russian occupiers? Blocking for 6 days for this??? https://t.co/Rkp1M1yKcX"
