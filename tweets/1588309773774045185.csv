In America it's OK to not agree with someone without falsely accusing them.  Clinton-Fake Dossier  Biden-Ukraine are more serious. Grow the Heck Up.

1588309383561195520,Thu Nov 03 23:17:21 +0000 2022,@berlin_bridge I’m on the fence on this one. The Herman leopard is one of the most advanced tanks on the planet. I am not sure it’s a good idea to give them to Ukraine. If Putin gets his hands on them he’ll use them against Germany. You know he has been itching to match to Berlin.

When Russia colonized Ukraine, they surpassed the Ukrainian language and culture. To be successful you had to speak Russian. That's how you get ""ethnic Russians"""

Additionally, the Black Sea fleet.  But experts knew this would be the exact way the chess board played out years before.
