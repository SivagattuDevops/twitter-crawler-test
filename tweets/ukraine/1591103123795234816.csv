I get the feeling these MAGAs believe Biden writes a physical check and sends it via mail.

Reality is, the $$$ flows into American weapon manufacture's accounts."
1591102866491858944,Fri Nov 11 16:17:39 +0000 2022,@FrankRGardner IMO - It's a disaster a few months ago. Now it's a strategic withdrawal which Russia has prepared the propaganda for. Makes sense now that their objectives have shifted to hacking a large chunk of Ukraine off and not the whole thing. But a great victory for Ukraine nonetheless.
