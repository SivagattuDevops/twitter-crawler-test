The required language is Ukrainian from 5th grade on. But you can still take Russian as a language. Same thing in the U.S. Schools generally teach in English.

It is smth which was then and is now  being used excessively to justify Ukr. embracing nazism.  The 30s were very hard not only in Ukraine but in other places like Sothern Russia, Volga River region, Central Russia region."
