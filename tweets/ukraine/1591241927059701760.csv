Is Ukraine hitting targets at 100km+ regularly? If no, then no ATACMS. If yes, then yes ATACMS."
1591241552533540865,Sat Nov 12 01:28:44 +0000 2022,"@TreasChest Diplomacy. Negotiate &amp; compromise they say.

Whose lives do you negotiate away? 

How do you compromise with genocidal imperialism?

Who is sacrificed to satisfy putina?

The compromise is simple. RU army leaves Ukraine.

Anyone that wants to be Russian goes with them.

Simple."

Most obviously criminal pedo scum to ever steal office. Protests around the world show the pedocrat run dominion voting system is a crime against fair elections. Resign and face the music.
