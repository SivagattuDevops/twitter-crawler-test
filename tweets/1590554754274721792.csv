I’ve been advocating for my rights as a woman and as a member of the lgbtq community. I’ve literally dedicated my life to medicine (which I think takes quite a bit of focus), so please touch grass &amp; stop projecting 😂🤡"

As for Ukraine, that is a defence of a newly democratic country being invaded by an Oligarchic Tyranny. I'd rather our tax dollars being spent on defending democracy then defending a corporatist profit grab."
