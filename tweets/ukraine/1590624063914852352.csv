Because then only the wealthy will survive and peasants and slaves will suffer. Europe and UK will help Ukraine with or without the US. Putin success along with Trump nazism will make fascism difficult to kill.

By your standards our reporters in Ukraine should keep Russia informed as putin claims a legal right to wage war on an innocent country. Surely medias job is just to report"

Yes Ukraine has won. It's a matter of time."
