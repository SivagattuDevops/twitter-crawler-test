A flipping fact. 
Zelinskyy just bought his mom and dad a 8 million $ house and 3 new cars andit wasn't in Ukraine. Has houses across the world. Ukraine and Russia are the same. Wake up"

You seem to be unable to grasp that Putin is the one who invaded Ukraine. His troops are the ones killing innocent civilians. He is responsible for those deaths."
