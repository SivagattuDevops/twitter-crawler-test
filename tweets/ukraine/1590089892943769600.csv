The inflation reduction act has handed out millions to Ukraine and special interests. Any Democrat that helped to pass this needs to be investigated. @brie0781 Thanks for pointing out that nobody in the GOP had anything to do with this scam."
1590089474884907009,Tue Nov 08 21:10:47 +0000 2022,@coolsuntanman @Tendar The reason we haven't seen much movement from Ukraine is that we have entered the Rasputitsa season. It makes it difficult to move about with heavy machinery. Next year Ukraine will have at least 25.000 new troops to enter the fight.

This is essentially Cuban Missile Crisis in reverse.
